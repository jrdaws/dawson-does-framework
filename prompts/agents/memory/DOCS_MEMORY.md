## 💭 Insights for Next Agent

1. **Style**: Keep sentences short, use "you" (second person)
2. **Examples**: Every concept needs a code example
3. **Structure**: Use tables, bullet points, code blocks
4. **Cross-refs**: Link to related docs
5. **Reference**: CODING_STANDARDS.md is the formatting model
