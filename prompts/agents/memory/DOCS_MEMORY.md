- Cross-reference related docs
- Keep sections short and scannable

## 💭 Insights for Next Agent

1. **Style**: Keep sentences short, use "you" (second person)
2. **Examples**: Every concept needs a code example
3. **Structure**: Use tables, bullet points, code blocks
4. **Cross-refs**: Link to related docs
5. **Reference**: CODING_STANDARDS.md is the formatting model
6. **GLOSSARY**: Comprehensive term list now available - reference it when writing docs
7. **FILE_STRUCTURE**: Already complete - no need to recreate, just reference it
