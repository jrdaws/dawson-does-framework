## Per-Asset Review

### ✅ hero-workspace.webp - APPROVED (92/100)

- **Photorealism**: 40/40 - Excellent professional commercial photography quality
- **Device Accuracy**: ✅ MacBook Pro laptop (correct!)
- **Composition**: 25/30 - Beautiful setup with natural light, plant, desk accessories
- **Technical**: 27/30 - Correct dimensions, optimized

**Note**: Screen shows macOS wallpaper instead of requested gradient glow, but this is acceptable as it's neutral, professional content. Can be composited if needed.

### ❌ hero-workspace-mobile.webp - REJECTED (30/100)

- **Photorealism**: 10/40 - **CRITICAL FAILURE**: Keyboard is destroyed/melted
- **Device Accuracy**: ✅ MacBook Pro laptop (correct!)
- **Composition**: 10/30 - Good angle, marred by keyboard issue

**Critical Issue**: The keyboard shows severe AI generation artifacts - keys are warped, charred, deformed with large holes and missing sections. Looks like fire damage. **Cannot be used.**

**Feedback Provided**: Added negative prompts for "damaged keyboard, broken keys, melted" etc.

### ✅ empty-state-data.webp - APPROVED (95/100)

- **Concept Accuracy**: 40/40 - **EXCELLENT** - Correctly shows empty clipboard/document
- **Brand Colors**: 30/30 - Perfect indigo + emerald green
- **Style**: 25/30 - Clean flat design, vector-style illustration

**Highlights**: Massive improvement from iteration 1. Correctly represents empty state concept.
