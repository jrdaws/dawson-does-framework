## Executive Summary

The critical execution gap from previous cycles appears to be breaking as Website Agent has been actively executing tasks, though 35+ inbox tasks remain pending across executor agents.

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (P1)
1. **4 uncommitted files** - Local changes in FRAMEWORK_MAP.md, AccordionSidebar.tsx, and new design demo files need to be committed

### Important Gaps (P2)
1. **Testing backlog** - 11 tasks pending in Testing Agent inbox (accordion tests, OAuth E2E, etc.)
2. **Website backlog** - 9 tasks pending including Connected Services UI
3. **Media review pending** - HubSpot color assets awaiting approval

### Minor Gaps (P3)
1. **Documentation backlog** - 4 tasks pending (coding standards, deployment guides)
2. **Research backlog** - 3 tasks pending

---

## Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Owner | Resolution Path |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Uncommitted work | Low | Any Agent | `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: commit pending work"` |
| Testing tasks stacking | Medium | Testing Agent | Activate Testing Agent to clear inbox |
| Vercel primary domain | Low | Human | Dashboard config (Root Dir=website) |

---

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

### Priority 1 (Must Do)
1. **Commit uncommitted work** - 4 files need to be staged and committed (FRAMEWORK_MAP.md, AccordionSidebar.tsx, design demos, QA report)
2. **Run accordion sidebar tests** - Testing Agent has pending P1 task

### Priority 2 (Should Do)
1. **Implement Connected Services UI** - Backend ready, multiple P2 tasks waiting
2. **Complete Supabase OAuth E2E testing** - Multiple tasks in Testing inbox
3. **Review and approve HubSpot color assets** - In Media inbox

### Priority 3 (Could Do)
1. **Clear Testing Agent inbox** - 11 tasks pending
2. **Update deployment guides** - Documentation Agent has pending P3 tasks
