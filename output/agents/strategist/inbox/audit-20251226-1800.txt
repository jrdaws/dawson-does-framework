## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (P0)
1. **Uncommitted Work**: 24 files (5 modified + 19 untracked) need to be committed. This has persisted through multiple cycles despite P0 commit tasks distributed.

### Important Gaps (P1)
1. **CLI Agent Unresponsive**: 4 separate P0 commit tasks sitting in CLI inbox from cycles 11-17, none executed
2. **Testing Backlog**: 13 tasks accumulated in Testing Agent inbox
3. **Accordion Tests Incomplete**: New spec file for accordion sidebar not finished

### Minor Gaps (P2)
1. **Documentation Backlog**: 5 tasks pending (coding standards, deployment guides)
2. **Research Backlog**: 3 tasks pending

---

## Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Owner | Resolution Path |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Uncommitted files (24) | High | CLI Agent | `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: commit cycle 17 work" && git push` |
| CLI Agent inactive | High | Human | Manually activate CLI Agent session |
| Vercel primary domain | Low | Human | Configure Root Dir=website in Vercel dashboard |

---

## Agent Inbox Backlog

| Agent | Inbox Tasks | Priority |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Testing | 13 | High (oldest backlog) |
| Website | 10 | Medium |
| CLI | 5 | Critical (P0 commits) |
| Documentation | 5 | Low |
| Research | 3 | Low |
| Media | 3 | Low |
| Quality | 2 | Medium |
| Platform | 1 | Low |
| Curator | 13 | Controller cycle |
| Strategist | 12 | Controller cycle |

---

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

### Priority 0 (Immediate)
1. **Execute commit**: Run `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: commit Navy theme and cycle 17 work" && git push` - 24 files waiting

### Priority 1 (Must Do)
1. **Clear Testing backlog**: Execute oldest 3-5 Testing Agent tasks (accordion tests, OAuth E2E)
2. **Activate CLI Agent**: Process P0 commit tasks in inbox

### Priority 2 (Should Do)
1. **Connected Services UI**: Backend routes ready, needs frontend implementation
2. **Clear Website backlog**: 10 tasks pending
3. **Documentation updates**: CODING_STANDARDS.md still missing

### Priority 3 (Could Do)
1. **Research tasks**: Clear 3 pending research items
2. **Media tasks**: Clear 3 pending media items
