# Audit Report

## Executive Summary

**Tests stable at 732 passing (8 consecutive cycles).** Five Navy theme commits from Website Agent in the last 6 hours demonstrate continued execution. However, **54 uncommitted changes** (16 modified + 38 untracked) represent a critical P0 blocker that has persisted since Cycle 11. CLI Agent remains unresponsive despite multiple P0 commit tasks. The execution gap that broke in Cycle 16 remains resolved but uncommitted work continues to accumulate.

## Progress Assessment

### Goals Met This Cycle
- [x] Navy theme implementation complete (all website components)
- [x] Design demos created (3 variants: light, navy, warm-sand)
- [x] Navy theme QA report generated
- [x] Sidebar variants demo created
- [x] HubSpot adapted color tokens documented
- [x] Duplicate inbox tasks archived (CLI, Testing, Website)

### Goals In Progress
- [ ] Commit all uncommitted work - **54 files pending** (up from 24)
- [ ] Connected services UI - backend ready
- [ ] Accordion sidebar testing

### Goals Not Started
- [ ] Supabase OAuth E2E testing
- [ ] Missing documentation (CODING_STANDARDS.md)
- [ ] User testing

---

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (P0)
1. **Uncommitted Work**: 54 files (16 modified, 13 deleted, 38 untracked) - **must commit immediately**
2. **CLI Agent Unresponsive**: P0 commit tasks from Cycles 11-18 never executed

### Important Gaps (P1)
1. **Testing Backlog**: 10 tasks in inbox (accordion tests, OAuth E2E, validation tasks)
2. **Inbox Accumulation**: Tasks continue to pile up without execution

### Minor Gaps (P2-P3)
1. **Documentation Backlog**: 6 tasks pending (coding standards, deployment guides)
2. **Website Backlog**: New connected services tasks awaiting execution
3. **Strategist Draft Backlog**: 12 draft tasks awaiting distribution

---

## Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Owner | Resolution Path |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Uncommitted files (54) | Critical | Human/CLI | `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: commit cycle 18 work" && git push` |
| CLI Agent inactive | High | Human | Manually execute commit or activate CLI Agent |
| Vercel primary domain | Low | Human | Configure Root Dir=website in Vercel dashboard |

| Documentation | 6 | 2025-12-23 | Medium |
| Website | 2+ | 2025-12-26 | Medium |

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

### Priority 0 (Immediate - CRITICAL)
1. **Execute commit NOW**: Run `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: commit Navy theme, design demos, and cycle 18 work" && git push`
   - 54 files uncommitted for 7+ cycles
   - Risk of work loss increasing

### Priority 1 (Must Do)
1. **Clear Testing backlog**: Execute accordion tests, OAuth E2E, uploadthing validation
2. **Verify commit includes all files**: Ensure design demos, QA reports, and memory updates are captured

### Priority 2 (Should Do)
1. **Connected Services UI**: Implement frontend for backend routes
2. **Documentation**: Create CODING_STANDARDS.md to resolve dead links
3. **Clear strategist draft backlog**: Distribute pending cycle tasks

### Priority 3 (Could Do)
1. **Sidebar demo polish**: sidebar-variants demo ready for review
2. **Research tasks**: 3 pending items

## Metrics

| Metric | Cycle 17 | Cycle 18 | Trend |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| Tests Passing | 732 | 732 | → stable (8 cycles) |
| Commits (6h) | 5 | 5 | → stable |
| Uncommitted Files | 24 | 54 | ⚠️⚠️ ↑↑ CRITICAL |
| Active Agents | 1 | 1 | → (Website) |
| Testing Backlog | 13 | 10 | ↓ (archived dups) |
| Execution Gap | BROKEN | BROKEN | ✅ resolved |

### Uncommitted Files Trend (CRITICAL)

| Cycle | Modified | Untracked | Total | Commits |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|---------|
| 11 | 4 | 10 | 14 | 56 |
| 12 | 8 | 14 | 22 | 20 |
| 13 | 8 | 15+ | 23+ | 1 |
| 14-15 | ~8 | ~15 | ~23 | 2-4 |
| 16 | 4 | 0 | 4 | 5 |
| 17 | 5 | 19 | 24 | 5 |
| **18** | **16** | **38** | **54** | **5** |

**Pattern**: Work is being done (commits happening) but auxiliary files (reports, memory, demos) accumulate without being committed.
