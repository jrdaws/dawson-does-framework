## 4. Agent Activity Summary

### Controller Agents (Governance Loop)

## 5. Progress Against Goals

### Phase 1 Milestones (COMPLETE)
All 17 Phase 1 milestones remain complete.

### Current Sprint Goals (5DS Clone Phase 7)
| Goal | Status | Blocker |
|------|--------|---------|
| Accordion sidebar implemented | ✅ Done | - |
| SupabaseSetup integrated | ✅ Done | - |
| Supabase OAuth routes | ✅ Done | Needs E2E testing |
| Clone command + feature-assembler | ✅ Done | - |
| **Accordion UI tests** | ⏸️ Waiting | Testing agent not activated |
| **Connected services UI** | ⏸️ Waiting | Website agent not activated |

## 6. Gaps and Risks

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Execution Gap (5 Cycles and Counting)
- **Issue**: Governance agents (Auditor → Strategist → Curator) are running, but executor agents are not being activated
- **Pattern**: Same tasks redistributed every cycle with no progress
- **Task Backlog**: 35+ inbox items across executor agents
- **Impact**: New features not being built; work piling up
- **Root Cause**: Human activation required; no autonomous agent execution
- **Mitigation**: Human must manually trigger executor agents

### 🟡 Uncommitted Work (Reduced)
- **Current**: 1 file (FRAMEWORK_MAP.md) - down from 22 in Cycle 13
- **Status**: Cycle 13 commit resolved bulk of uncommitted files
- **Action**: Commit remaining file this cycle

### 🟡 Missing Documentation
- Files referenced but don't exist:
  - `docs/deploy/vercel.md`
  - `docs/deploy/netlify.md`
  - `docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md`
- **Impact**: Dead links, incomplete onboarding
- **Assigned To**: Documentation Agent (P3)

---

## 7. Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Owner | Resolution |
|---------|--------|-------|------------|
| Executor agents not activated | No new features | Human | Activate CLI/Testing/Website agents |
| Vercel env vars not set | AI generation fails | Human | Configure in Vercel dashboard |
| Primary domain needs Root Dir=website | SEO/branding | Human | Vercel dashboard setting |

---

## 8. Recommendations

### Immediate (P0)
1. **PAUSE GOVERNANCE LOOP** - Cycles 11-15 show governance-only activity. Stop cycling audits and activate executors instead.
2. **Commit FRAMEWORK_MAP.md** - 1 uncommitted file remaining

### This Cycle (P1)
3. **Activate Testing Agent** - Run accordion UI tests (spec file exists: `website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts`)
4. **Activate Website Agent** - Implement connected services UI (backend routes ready)

### Next Cycle (P2)
5. **Run Supabase OAuth E2E tests** - Validate integration end-to-end
6. **Set Vercel environment variables** - Unblock production AI generation

### Documentation (P3)
7. **Create CODING_STANDARDS.md** - Referenced by governance docs but missing
8. **Create deployment guides** - vercel.md, netlify.md for production setup
