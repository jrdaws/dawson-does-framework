# Task: Clear Duplicate Tasks from Inboxes

## Context
Multiple cycles have created duplicate task files in agent inboxes:
- Testing inbox has 13 tasks (many duplicates: accordion tests x4, OAuth E2E x4)

## Files to Review
- `output/agents/testing/inbox/` - 13 files
- `output/agents/website/inbox/` - 10 files

## Handoff
