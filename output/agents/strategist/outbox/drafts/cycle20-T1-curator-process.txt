# Task: Process and Archive Curator Inbox

Priority: P1
Assigned To: Curator Agent
Depends On: None (T0 ideally first)
Estimated Effort: Medium (30 minutes)

## Context

The Curator inbox has accumulated 15 strategy files spanning Dec 23-27. This backlog is preventing task distribution to executor agents, contributing to the execution gap. Most older strategies have already been superseded.

## Objectives

1. Review all 15 strategy files in inbox
2. Archive strategies older than Dec 26 (already superseded)
3. Extract any still-relevant tasks from Dec 26-27 strategies
4. Distribute active tasks to executor agent inboxes
5. Update task tracking

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Curator inbox has ≤3 files (only Dec 27 strategies)
- [ ] Archived files moved to `output/agents/curator/done/`
- [ ] Relevant tasks copied to appropriate agent inboxes
- [ ] No duplicate tasks distributed
