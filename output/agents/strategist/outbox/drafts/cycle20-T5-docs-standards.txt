# Task: Create CODING_STANDARDS.md

Priority: P3
Assigned To: Documentation Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low (30 minutes)

## Context

The audit report identified missing documentation - specifically CODING_STANDARDS.md which is referenced but doesn't exist. This creates dead links and confusion for contributors.

## Objectives

1. Create comprehensive coding standards document
2. Cover JavaScript (.mjs) and TypeScript (.ts) conventions
3. Document commit message format
4. Include examples for common patterns

## Success Criteria

- [ ] File created at `docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md`
- [ ] Covers JS and TS conventions
- [ ] Includes commit message format (Conventional Commits)
- [ ] Has practical code examples
- [ ] Links work from AGENT_CONTEXT.md reference

## Files to Create

- `docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md`

## Content Outline

```markdown
# Coding Standards

## JavaScript (.mjs)
- No semicolons
- 2-space indentation
- ES modules (import/export)

## TypeScript (.ts/.tsx)
- Semicolons required
- 2-space indentation
- Strict mode enabled

## Commit Messages
- Format: type(scope): description
- Types: feat, fix, docs, chore, refactor, test

## API Patterns
- Use apiError/apiSuccess helpers
- Standard error response format

## Component Patterns
- React functional components
- Named exports preferred
```

## Reference Files

Pull conventions from:
- `AGENT_CONTEXT.md` - Basic rules
- `.cursorrules` - Additional context
- Existing code patterns in `src/` and `website/`

## Handoff

When complete:
1. Move task to `output/agents/documentation/done/`
2. Verify link from AGENT_CONTEXT.md works
3. End response with: `(DOCUMENTATION Agent)`
