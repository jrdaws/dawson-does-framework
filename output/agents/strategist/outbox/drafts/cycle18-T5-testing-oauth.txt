# Task: Supabase OAuth E2E Tests

Priority: P2
Assigned To: Testing Agent
Depends On: T4 (Connected Services UI)
Estimated Effort: Medium

## Context
Supabase OAuth integration is complete but lacks end-to-end test coverage. After the Connected Services UI is implemented, we can test the full OAuth flow.

## Objectives
1. Create E2E tests for Supabase OAuth flow
2. Test login, logout, and session persistence
3. Mock OAuth responses for CI environment

## Success Criteria
- [ ] E2E test file created
- [ ] Tests cover: login flow, logout flow, session persistence
- [ ] Tests pass in CI with mocked OAuth
- [ ] Error handling tested (invalid token, expired session)

## Files to Create
- `website/__tests__/e2e/supabase-oauth.test.tsx`

## Handoff
1. Run full test suite to verify no regressions
2. Commit with message: `test(website): add Supabase OAuth E2E tests`
3. Move this task to done/
4. Update TESTING_MEMORY.md
