# Task: Validate UploadThing Integration Tests

Priority: P1
Assigned To: Testing Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Medium (30 minutes)

## Context

UploadThing storage integration was added as part of Phase 1 completion. The integration tests need validation to ensure the feature works correctly across all use cases. This task has been in the Testing backlog since Dec 23.

## Objectives

1. Run UploadThing integration tests
2. Verify API routes function correctly
3. Test file upload flow (mock or real)
4. Document test results

## Success Criteria

- [ ] UploadThing tests pass
- [ ] API route tests pass  
- [ ] No TypeScript errors in integration files
- [ ] Test results documented

## Files to Verify

Integration files:
- `templates/saas/integrations/uploadthing/`
- `templates/flagship-saas/integrations/uploadthing/`

Test files:
- Any tests in `tests/` referencing uploadthing

## Commands

```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework
npm test -- --grep "uploadthing\|upload" 2>/dev/null || npm test
```

## Verification Steps

1. Check integration scaffold works:
   ```bash
   node bin/framework.js list-integrations | grep -i upload
   ```

2. Verify template files exist:
   ```bash
   ls templates/saas/integrations/uploadthing/
   ```

## Handoff

When complete:
1. Move task to `output/agents/testing/done/`
2. Create validation report in `output/agents/testing/outbox/`
3. End response with: `(TESTING Agent)`
