# Task: Commit All Uncommitted Work

Priority: P0 (CRITICAL)
Assigned To: Human
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low (5 minutes)

## Context

58 files have been uncommitted for 8+ cycles. This includes governance reports, design demos, and agent workspace files. Leaving these uncommitted risks data loss and creates confusion about the true state of the codebase.

## Objectives

1. Stage all changed files (modified, deleted, untracked)
2. Commit with a descriptive message
3. Push to origin/main

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `git status --short` returns empty (no uncommitted files)
- [ ] Commit appears in `git log` with appropriate message
- [ ] Changes visible on remote repository

## Commands to Execute

```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: commit Cycle 19 governance work, demos, and reports"
git push origin main
```

## Files Affected

- 16 modified files
- 13 deleted files  
- 29 untracked files
- Total: 58 files

## Handoff

After completing:
1. Verify with `git status`
2. No further action needed - this unblocks all other Cycle 20 tasks
