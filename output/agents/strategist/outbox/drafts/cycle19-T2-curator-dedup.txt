# Task: Deduplicate Agent Inboxes

Priority: P1
Assigned To: Curator Agent
Depends On: T1 (Commit must complete first)
Estimated Effort: Low

## Context
Multiple PDCA cycles have created duplicate task files:
- Testing inbox: 4 versions of accordion tests, 4 versions of OAuth E2E
- Website inbox: 3 versions of connected services UI

This inflates backlog metrics and causes executor confusion.

## Objectives
1. Scan Testing Agent inbox for duplicate tasks
2. Scan Website Agent inbox for duplicate tasks  
3. Keep only the latest version of each unique task
4. Archive older duplicates to done/archived-duplicates/

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Testing inbox reduced from 13 to <6 unique tasks
- [ ] Website inbox reduced from 10 to <4 unique tasks
- [ ] Archived tasks documented
- [ ] No unique tasks lost

## Files to Review
- output/agents/testing/inbox/ - 13 files
- output/agents/website/inbox/ - 10 files

## Handoff
1. Document what was archived in completion report
2. Move this task to done/
3. Update velocity metrics if needed
