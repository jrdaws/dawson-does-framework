# Task: Commit All Uncommitted Work

Priority: P0 (CRITICAL - BLOCKING ALL OTHER WORK)
Assigned To: Human (escalated from CLI Agent after 7 cycles)
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low (2 minutes)

## Context
54 files now uncommitted (up from 24 last cycle). This includes:
- 16 modified files (governance, memory, framework map)
- 13 deleted files (archived duplicate tasks)
- 38 untracked files (new reports, design demos, task prompts)

The CLI Agent has not processed any of the 4 P0 commit tasks in its inbox since Cycle 11. This is now CRITICAL - uncommitted work has TRIPLED and risks data loss.

## Objectives
1. Stage all changes
2. Commit with descriptive message
3. Push to origin/main

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `git status` shows clean working directory
- [ ] All 54 files committed
- [ ] Changes pushed to origin/main

## Commands to Execute
