# Task: Commit All Uncommitted Work

Priority: P0
Assigned To: Human (escalated from CLI Agent)
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low (5 minutes)

## Context
24 files (5 modified + 19 untracked) have remained uncommitted for 6+ cycles. The CLI Agent has 4 pending P0 commit tasks in inbox, none executed. This is a critical blocker - Website Agent completed Navy theme work that needs to be preserved.

## Objectives
1. Stage all uncommitted files
2. Commit with descriptive message
3. Push to origin/main

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `git status` shows clean working directory
- [ ] All 24 files committed to main branch
- [ ] Changes pushed to remote

## Commands to Execute

git add -A
git commit -m "chore: commit Navy theme work and cycle 17 governance files

- Navy theme implementation (ProtectedRoute, LandingPage, forms, cards, buttons)
- Cycle 17 audit reports and strategy documents
- QA reports and design demos
- AccordionSidebar updates"
git push origin main

## Handoff
1. Verify push succeeded
2. Run `git status` to confirm clean state
3. Continue with remaining cycle tasks
