# Task: Chunked Code Generation

Priority: P1
Assigned To: Platform Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: High

## Context
Complex projects with many files truncate at output limits. This breaks the AI generation flow for larger SaaS projects. Implementing chunked generation will allow large codebases to be generated in multiple passes.

## Objectives
1. Modify code generator to detect when output will exceed limits
2. Implement chunking strategy to split generation into stages
3. Add progress tracking for multi-chunk generation
4. Ensure chunks combine correctly into complete project

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Projects with 20+ files generate completely
- [ ] Progress indicator shows chunk status
- [ ] All chunks combine into valid project structure
- [ ] Existing tests continue to pass

## Files to Modify
- packages/ai-agent/src/code-generator.ts
- packages/ai-agent/src/types.ts
- website/lib/generation/ (if applicable)

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Document chunking approach in outbox/
3. Update PLATFORM_MEMORY.md
