## Context

Backend API routes for connected services are complete, but the frontend UI to display and manage them is not yet implemented. This feature will show users what external services (GitHub, Supabase, UploadThing, etc.) are connected to their project.

## Objectives

1. Create ConnectedServicesPanel component
2. Display list of available integrations
3. Show connection status for each service
4. Implement connect/disconnect UI (visual only - backend exists)
5. Follow Navy theme design system

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Component renders without errors
- [ ] Shows at least 3 integration options (GitHub, Supabase, UploadThing)
- [ ] Connection status indicator (connected/disconnected)
- [ ] Follows Navy theme color scheme (60-30-10 rule)
- [ ] Responsive design (mobile + desktop)

## Files to Modify

Create new files:
- `website/components/dashboard/ConnectedServicesPanel.tsx`
- `website/components/dashboard/ServiceCard.tsx`

Modify:
- `website/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` - Add panel

## Design Requirements

Follow Navy theme:
- Primary (60%): Navy #1a1f2e
- Secondary (30%): Gold accent #d4af37
- Accent (10%): Status indicators

Component structure:
```tsx
<ConnectedServicesPanel>
  <ServiceCard 
    name="GitHub" 
    icon={<GitHubIcon />}
    status="connected" | "disconnected"
    onConnect={() => {}}
  />
  ...
</ConnectedServicesPanel>
```

## Handoff

When complete:
1. Run `npm run build` to verify no build errors
2. Move task to `output/agents/website/done/`
3. Create screenshot or description in outbox
4. End response with: `(WEBSITE Agent)`
