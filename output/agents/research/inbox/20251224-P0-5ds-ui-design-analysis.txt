TASK: 5DaySprint UI Design Analysis & Specification
PRIORITY: P0 (Blocking all UI work)
TYPE: Research + Design Specification

---

## Objective

Analyze the provided 5DaySprint platform screenshots and create a detailed UI/UX design specification that Website Agent can implement. The current implementation does NOT match the reference design.

## Current Problem

The current dawson-does-framework configurator has:
- A skinny icon-only sidebar (56px)
- Horizontal step navigation
- Standard card-based content areas

The 5DaySprint design has:
- A WIDE accordion-style sidebar (~280-320px)
- Collapsible sections with inline content
- Three-column layout (sidebar | main content | live preview)

## Screenshots to Analyze

The user has provided 21 screenshots showing:

1. **My Projects Dashboard** - Grid of project cards with terminal-style headers
2. **New Project - Research Phase** - Accordion sidebar with:
   - Research section (expanded with form fields)
   - Core Features, Integrate AI, Cursor, GitHub, Claude Code, Supabase, Vercel (collapsed)
3. **Core Features Selection** - Expandable feature categories with checkboxes
4. **AI Integration** - Provider selection with API key inputs
5. **Tool Setup Steps** - Guided wizard for each tool
6. **Generate Prompt** - Final review with file tree and NPX command

## Required Deliverables

Create `output/shared/design/5DS_UI_SPECIFICATION.md` with:

### 1. Layout Structure
- Exact measurements for sidebar width, panel widths
- Responsive breakpoints
- Header/footer heights

### 2. Sidebar Accordion Component
- Section structure (icon, title, subtitle, chevron)
- Expanded vs collapsed states
- Active section styling (left border accent)
- Completion indicators (checkmarks)
- Content that appears INSIDE expanded sections

### 3. Color Palette
- Primary blue: #0052FF (from screenshots)
- Background colors
- Text colors
- Status colors (success green, warning, error)

### 4. Typography
- Font families used
- Heading sizes
- Body text sizes
- Label styles

### 5. Component Specifications
For each unique component, document:
- Visual appearance
- States (default, hover, active, disabled, complete)
- Spacing/padding
- Border radius

Key components to spec:
- AccordionSection
- ProjectCard (terminal header style)
- FeatureCheckbox
- GuidedSetupStep
- NPXCommandCard
- FileTreeView
- CompletionBadge

### 6. Interaction Patterns
- How sections expand/collapse
- How users navigate between steps
- Form validation feedback
- Loading states

### 7. Implementation Roadmap
Ordered list of components to build, with dependencies

## Reference Files

Current implementation to compare:
- website/app/components/configurator/ConfiguratorSidebar.tsx
- website/app/components/configurator/ConfiguratorWorkspace.tsx
- website/app/configure/page.tsx

## Output

Save specification to: `output/shared/design/5DS_UI_SPECIFICATION.md`
Save component mockups to: `output/shared/design/components/`

## Handoff

When complete, create inbox tasks for Website Agent with specific component implementations based on the spec.
