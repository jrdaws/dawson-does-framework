ADVANCED PROJECT: Dawson-Does-Framework UI Redesign
=====================================================

AGENT: Quality Agent (Media Pipeline)
PROJECT: Framework UI Clone - Quality Review
PRIORITY: P1 - HIGH
DATE: 2025-12-23

PREREQUISITE:
-------------
Wait for Media Agent to complete and check for assets:
```bash
ls output/media-pipeline/quality-agent/inbox/review-framework-ui-redesign.txt
ls output/media-pipeline/shared/assets/framework-ui-redesign/
```

If no assets exist, wait for Media Agent to complete first.


OBJECTIVE:
----------
Review all generated assets for the dawson-does-framework UI redesign. Ensure 
they meet quality standards, match the style guide, and will create a cohesive, 
user-friendly website when implemented.


STEP 1: GATHER MATERIALS
------------------------

```bash
# Read original brief
cat output/media-pipeline/shared/briefs/framework-ui-redesign-brief.md

# Read asset manifest
cat output/media-pipeline/shared/assets/framework-ui-redesign/asset-manifest.json

# List all assets
ls -la output/media-pipeline/shared/assets/framework-ui-redesign/optimized/
```


STEP 2: STYLE CONSISTENCY CHECK
-------------------------------

This project requires EXTRA attention to style consistency since all assets 
must work together as a cohesive design system.

### Style Checklist
| Check | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Color consistency | All assets use the defined palette |
| Icon style | All icons use same stroke/fill approach |
| Visual weight | Consistent across all graphics |
| Mood/tone | Professional, approachable, modern |
| Quality level | No asset looks out of place |


STEP 3: REVIEW EACH ASSET CATEGORY
----------------------------------

### 3.1 Hero Assets (40 points)
| Criterion | Points | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Visual impact | 10 | First impression matters |
| Color alignment | 10 | Matches palette exactly |
| Mobile version works | 10 | Responsive-ready |
| No artifacts | 10 | Clean, professional |

### 3.2 Feature Icons (30 points)
| Criterion | Points | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Style consistency | 10 | All 6 match perfectly |
| Recognizable meaning | 10 | Icons communicate purpose |
| Scalability | 10 | Work at 32px and 128px |

### 3.3 Demo Visuals (20 points)
| Criterion | Points | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Realistic mockups | 10 | Believable screenshots |
| Clean presentation | 10 | No clutter or confusion |

### 3.4 Supporting Assets (10 points)
| Criterion | Points | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Backgrounds subtle | 5 | Don't overpower content |
| Patterns tileable | 5 | Seamless if needed |


STEP 4: CROSS-ASSET HARMONY CHECK
---------------------------------

View all assets together and verify:

□ Do all assets look like they belong to the same brand?
□ Is the color palette consistent across all assets?
□ Would these work together on a single page?
□ Is there a clear visual hierarchy?
□ Does the overall feel say "user-friendly" and "professional"?


STEP 5: ACCESSIBILITY CHECK
---------------------------

□ Text on backgrounds has sufficient contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
□ Icons are recognizable without color (shape matters)
□ Decorative elements don't interfere with content
□ Would work in dark mode AND light mode


STEP 6: CREATE REVIEW REPORT
----------------------------

Write to `output/media-pipeline/quality-agent/workspace/framework-ui-redesign-review.md`:

```markdown
