# Task: Commit Uncommitted Work

Priority: **P0 (CRITICAL - DO IMMEDIATELY)**
Assigned To: CLI Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low (5-10 minutes)
Cycle: 14 (Curated)
Quality Score: 9.2/10

---

## Context

The Auditor has identified **22 uncommitted files** persisting for **4+ cycles**:
- 8 modified files (governance, tests, memory files)
- 14 untracked files (reports, task drafts, test specs)

This is a **CRITICAL hygiene issue**:
- Work is at risk of loss
- Git status shows dirty state
- Other agents see stale repository state
- ALL other tasks are blocked until this is resolved

---

## Objectives

1. Stage all modified and untracked files
2. Commit with descriptive message
3. Push to origin main
4. Verify clean git status

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `git status` shows "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
- [ ] Commit pushed to origin/main
- [ ] No files lost in process
- [ ] Commit appears in `git log --oneline -1`

---

## Commands to Execute

```bash
# 1. Verify current state
git status

# 2. Stage all changes
git add -A

# 3. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "chore(audit): cycle 14 - commit 4 cycles of uncommitted work

- Governance reports (audit, strategy, cycle summaries)
- Task drafts and inbox files
- Memory file updates
- Test files (accordion spec, uploadthing e2e)
- Framework map and priority updates"

# 4. Push to origin
git push origin main

# 5. Verify clean state
git status
```
