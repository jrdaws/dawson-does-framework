# Strategy Report

Cycle: 8

Responding to: audit-20251224-0330.txt

## Executive Summary

**EXECUTION FOCUS - NO NEW TASKS**

The Auditor identified a critical execution gap: 9 tasks queued, 0 executed since Cycle 5. This strategy does NOT create new tasks. Instead, it provides:
1. Clear prioritization of existing tasks
2. Launch instructions for worker agents
3. Dependency map for optimal execution order

---

## Strategic Priorities

Based on Auditor's findings, this cycle focuses on:

1. **Close the Execution Gap**: Launch worker agents to execute queued P1/P2 tasks
2. **Validate New Features**: UploadThing and Design Resources need testing before production
3. **Unblock Production Deployment**: Create deployment checklist so human can deploy

## Task Matrix (Existing Tasks - DO NOT CREATE NEW ONES)

| ID | Task | Agent | Priority | Effort | Inbox File |

## Launch Order (Recommended)

### Phase 1: Immediate (Launch Now)
Execute these 3 tasks in parallel - no dependencies:

| Order | Task | Agent | Why Now |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 1a | T1: UploadThing Validation | Testing | P1, validates new integration |
| 1b | T2: Deployment Guide | Documentation | Low effort, unblocks human |
| 1c | T3: Design Resources Validation | Testing | P2, can run alongside T1 |

### Phase 2: After Phase 1 Completes
| Order | Task | Agent | Depends On |
|-------|------|-------|------------|
| 2a | T4: Chunked Code Generation | Platform | None (complex, needs focus) |
| 2b | T5: User Feedback API | Website | Production deployment |

### Phase 3: Backlog (Next Cycle)
| Task | Agent | Reason for Deferral |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| T6: Integration Test Expansion | Testing | Agent already has 2 tasks |
| T7: Flagship-SaaS Integrations | Template | P3, lower priority |
| T8: Integration Selection UX | CLI | P2, backlog item |
| T9: API Documentation Update | Documentation | Agent already has 1 task |

---

## Resource Allocation (This Cycle)

### Testing Agent - 2 Tasks (Max Capacity)
1. **T1: UploadThing Validation** (P1) ← Execute FIRST
2. **T3: Design Resources Validation** (P2) ← Execute SECOND

### Documentation Agent - 1 Task
1. **T2: Deployment Execution Guide** (P2) ← Execute NOW

### Platform Agent - 0 Tasks This Cycle
- T4 (Chunked Code Generation) is complex, needs focused session
- Recommend deferring to next cycle unless capacity available

### Website Agent - 0 Tasks This Cycle
- T5 depends on production deployment (blocked)

### Template Agent - 0 Tasks This Cycle
- T7 is P3, defer to next cycle

### CLI Agent - 0 Tasks This Cycle
- T8 is P2 backlog, defer to next cycle

## Dependencies Map

```
T1 (UploadThing) ─────────────────┐
                                   │
T2 (Deployment Guide) ────────────┼──▶ Production Deployment (Human)
                                   │
T3 (Design Resources) ────────────┘
                                         │
                                         ▼
                                   T5 (User Feedback API)

T4 (Chunked Code) ──────────▶ [Independent, can run anytime]

T6, T7, T8, T9 ──────────────▶ [Deferred to next cycle]

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Worker agents not launched | High | High | Provide clear launch commands below |
| Tasks take longer than expected | Medium | Low | Each task is time-boxed (~30-60 min) |
| TypeScript errors in validation | Low | Medium | Testing Agent can flag for fix |
| Deployment guide incomplete | Low | Low | Human can ask for updates |

---

## Launch Commands (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Launch Testing Agent (T1 + T3)

```
I'm the Testing Agent. I need to execute two validation tasks:

1. Read my task: output/testing-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P1-task-uploadthing-validation.txt
2. Execute UploadThing validation per the task instructions
3. When complete, read: output/testing-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P2-task-design-resources-validation.txt
4. Execute Design Resources validation
5. Move completed tasks to done/, write reports to outbox/
```

### Launch Documentation Agent (T2)

```
I'm the Documentation Agent. I need to execute one task:

1. Read my task: output/documentation-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P2-task-deployment-execution-guide.txt
2. Create the Vercel deployment checklist per the task instructions
3. Move completed task to done/, update my memory file
```

## Draft Prompts for Worker Agents

### T1: UploadThing Validation (Testing Agent)

**Status**: Task file already exists and is complete
**Location**: `output/testing-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P1-task-uploadthing-validation.txt`
**Action**: Launch Testing Agent with instruction to read and execute this task

Key success criteria:
- integration.json passes schema validation
- All 7 files present and valid TypeScript
- TypeScript compilation succeeds
- Documentation exists

### T2: Deployment Execution Guide (Documentation Agent)

**Status**: Task file already exists and is complete
**Location**: `output/documentation-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P2-task-deployment-execution-guide.txt`
**Action**: Launch Documentation Agent with instruction to read and execute this task

Key success criteria:
- Step-by-step checklist created
- All environment variables listed with sources
- Verification commands documented
- Rollback procedure included

### T3: Design Resources Validation (Testing Agent)

**Status**: Task file already exists and is complete
**Location**: `output/testing-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P2-task-design-resources-validation.txt`
**Action**: Testing Agent executes after T1 completes

Key success criteria:
- design-quality.md exists in src and dist
- tokens.json is valid JSON
- Code generator loads design reference without errors

## Deferred Items

Tasks explicitly NOT included this cycle:

| Task | Reason for Deferral |

| T5: User Feedback API | Blocked on production deployment |
| T6: Integration Test Expansion | Testing Agent at max capacity (2 tasks) |
| T7: Flagship-SaaS Integrations | P3 priority, defer to Phase 3 |
| T8: Integration Selection UX | P2 backlog, not critical path |
| T9: API Documentation Update | Documentation Agent at capacity |

---

## Metrics Targets

| Metric | Current | Target (End of Cycle) |
|--------|---------|----------------------|
| Tasks Completed | 0 | 3 (T1, T2, T3) |
| Tests Passing | 693 | 693+ (may add tests) |
| Open Blockers | 2 | 1 (unblock deployment) |

---

## Handoff

Report saved to: `output/shared/reports/strategy-20251224-0400.txt`
Next agent: CURATOR (to approve and distribute) OR directly launch worker agents

**Recommended Immediate Action**:
1. Launch Testing Agent with T1+T3
2. Launch Documentation Agent with T2
3. Skip Curator (tasks already curated in previous cycles)
