## Executive Analysis

### Current Situation
- **Phase 1 Complete**: All foundation milestones achieved
- **693 Tests Passing**: Zero regressions
- **9 Tasks Queued**: Already distributed to agent inboxes (from Curator cycle 6)
- **0 Tasks Executed Since Cycle 5**: Execution gap identified

### Critical Insight
**Tasks are accumulating faster than they're being executed.** This cycle's strategy focuses on EXECUTION over creation. We will NOT create new tasks, but instead:
1. Prioritize the TOP 3 tasks for immediate execution
2. Defer lower-priority tasks to next cycle
3. Ensure each recommended task is actionable NOW

---

## Strategic Priorities

Based on Auditor's findings and execution gap analysis:

1. **Execute UploadThing Validation (P1)**: New integration needs testing before production
2. **Complete Deployment Execution Guide (P2)**: Enables human to deploy to production
3. **Validate Design Resources (P2)**: New design system needs verification

**Why these 3?**
- UploadThing validation is critical path (new feature, untested)
- Deployment guide enables the biggest blocker (production deployment)
- Design resources validation catches issues early

---

## Task Matrix

### Active Tasks (Already in Inboxes - DO NOT CREATE NEW ONES)

| ID | Task | Agent | Priority | Status | Action |
|----|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| T1 | UploadThing Validation | Testing | P1 | 🔴 Ready | **EXECUTE NOW** |
| T2 | Chunked Code Generation | Platform | P1 | 🔴 Ready | Execute after T1 |
| T3 | Deployment Execution Guide | Documentation | P2 | 🔴 Ready | **EXECUTE NOW** |
| T4 | Design Resources Validation | Testing | P2 | 🔴 Ready | **EXECUTE NOW** |
| T5 | User Feedback API | Website | P2 | 🔴 Ready | Defer |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| No agents launched (execution gap continues) | High | High | Explicit launch commands in handoff |
| Testing Agent overloaded (2 P1/P2 tasks) | Medium | Medium | Sequential execution, T1 before T4 |
| Chunked generation takes longer than cycle | Medium | Low | Defer to next cycle if needed |
| Human doesn't deploy despite guide | Medium | High | Make guide extremely actionable |

---

## MoSCoW Prioritization

### Must Have (This Cycle)
- T1: UploadThing Validation - **Critical path**
- T3: Deployment Execution Guide - **Unblocks human action**

### Should Have
- T4: Design Resources Validation - New system verification

### Could Have
- T2: Chunked Code Generation - Complex, may span cycles

### Won't Have (Deferred)
- T5: User Feedback API - Needs production first
- T6: API Documentation Update - Lower priority
- T7: Integration Test Expansion - Can wait
- T8: Flagship-SaaS Integrations - P3
- T9: Integration Selection UX - Backlog

## Draft Task Prompts

**IMPORTANT**: These are REFINEMENTS of existing tasks, not new creations. The tasks already exist in agent inboxes.

### T1: UploadThing Validation (PRIORITY EXECUTION)

```
# Task: Validate UploadThing Storage Integration

Priority: P1 (CRITICAL PATH)
Assigned To: Testing Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Medium (1-2 hours)
Existing Task: output/testing-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P1-task-uploadthing-validation.txt

## Context
The UploadThing storage integration was completed in commit dd95924. Before production deployment, we MUST verify:
1. Integration files are complete and valid
2. TypeScript compiles without errors
3. Component imports work correctly

This is the first storage integration and sets the pattern for future integrations.

## Objectives
1. Validate integration.json schema compliance
2. Verify all 6 integration files exist and are syntactically correct
3. Run TypeScript compilation check
4. Test component import resolution
5. Verify .env.example documentation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] integration.json passes JSON parse and has required fields
- [ ] All files exist: route.ts, core.ts, file-upload.tsx, uploadthing.ts
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` passes for integration files
- [ ] Component can be imported in a test file
- [ ] UPLOADTHING_TOKEN documented in .env.example

## Files to Review
- templates/saas/integrations/storage/uploadthing/integration.json
- templates/saas/integrations/storage/uploadthing/app/api/uploadthing/route.ts
- templates/saas/integrations/storage/uploadthing/app/api/uploadthing/core.ts
- templates/saas/integrations/storage/uploadthing/lib/uploadthing.ts
- templates/saas/integrations/storage/uploadthing/components/storage/file-upload.tsx

## Handoff
1. Create validation report in output/testing-agent/outbox/
2. Move task from inbox/ to done/
3. If issues found, create bug report for Integration Agent
4. Update Testing Agent memory file
```

### T3: Deployment Execution Guide (PRIORITY EXECUTION)

```
# Task: Create Vercel Deployment Execution Checklist

Priority: P2 (ENABLES HUMAN ACTION)
Assigned To: Documentation Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low (30-60 min)
Existing Task: output/documentation-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P2-task-deployment-execution-guide.txt

## Context
All deployment PREPARATION is complete:
- vercel.json configured
- Environment variables documented
- Smoke tests ready
- CI/CD pipeline verified

The HUMAN needs a step-by-step execution checklist to actually deploy. This is the #1 blocker for user testing.

## Objectives
1. Create actionable, numbered checklist
2. List all environment variables with values/sources
3. Document verification steps after deployment
4. Include rollback procedure

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Checklist has numbered steps a non-technical user can follow
- [ ] Every environment variable listed with where to get the value
- [ ] Post-deployment verification commands included
- [ ] Estimated time to complete noted (should be <15 minutes)
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented

## Files to Create
- docs/deploy/VERCEL_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md

## Reference Files
- website/vercel.json
- docs/deploy/VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md
- website/.env.example

## Handoff
1. Save checklist to docs/deploy/
2. Move task from inbox/ to done/
3. Update Documentation Agent memory file
4. Notify in outbox that deployment is ready for human
```

### T4: Design Resources Validation (SHOULD HAVE)

```
# Task: Validate Design Resources System

Priority: P2 (NEW SYSTEM VERIFICATION)
Assigned To: Testing Agent
Depends On: T1 (do this second)
Estimated Effort: Low (30-60 min)
Existing Task: output/testing-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P2-task-design-resources-validation.txt

## Context
A design resources system was recently implemented:
- design-quality.md prompt for code generation
- tokens.json for design tokens
- loadDesignReference() function in code-generator

This needs verification before relying on it for production generation.

## Objectives
1. Verify design-quality.md exists in src/prompts
2. Verify design-quality.md is copied to dist/prompts after build
3. Validate tokens.json is valid JSON
4. Test loadDesignReference() doesn't error

## Success Criteria
- [ ] packages/ai-agent/src/prompts/design-quality.md exists
- [ ] packages/ai-agent/dist/prompts/design-quality.md exists
- [ ] templates/saas/design/tokens.json is valid JSON
- [ ] Code generator loads design reference without error

## Files to Review
- packages/ai-agent/src/code-generator.ts (loadDesignReference function)
- packages/ai-agent/src/prompts/design-quality.md
- templates/saas/design/tokens.json

## Handoff
1. Create validation report in output/testing-agent/outbox/
2. Move task from inbox/ to done/
3. If issues found, create bug report for Platform Agent
4. Update Testing Agent memory file
```

## Deferred Items

Tasks explicitly NOT prioritized this cycle:

| Task | Agent | Reason |
|------|-------|--------|
| Chunked Code Generation | Platform | Complex task, may need full cycle |
| User Feedback API | Website | Requires production deployment first |
| API Documentation Update | Documentation | Lower priority than deployment guide |
| Integration Test Expansion | Testing | Agent already has 2 tasks |
| Flagship-SaaS Integrations | Template | P3 priority |
| Integration Selection UX | CLI | Backlog item |

---

## Notes for Curator

1. **Do NOT create new tasks** - 9 already exist in inboxes
2. **Focus on launching agents** - Execution is the gap
3. **Top 3 tasks for immediate launch**:
   - Testing Agent: T1 (UploadThing) then T4 (Design)
   - Documentation Agent: T3 (Deployment Guide)
4. **Defer T2 (Chunked Generation)** - Let simpler tasks complete first

---

## Immediate Launch Commands

Copy these to new Cursor chats to execute the TOP 3 tasks:

**TESTING AGENT (UploadThing Validation - P1)**
