# Strategy Report

Cycle: 20
Date: 2025-12-27 06:30 NZT
Strategist: STRATEGIST Agent
Responding To: audit-20251227-0600.txt (Cycle 19)

---

## Executive Summary

This strategy addresses **critical execution gaps** identified over 9 consecutive cycles. The codebase is stable (732 tests passing for 9 cycles), but governance work is accumulating without execution. The primary blockers are:

1. **58 uncommitted files** (P0 - 8+ cycles overdue)
2. **Curator inbox overflow** (15 strategy files pending)
3. **Executor agent inactivity** (Testing: 7 tasks, Docs: 5 tasks)

This cycle's strategy focuses on **breaking the execution gap** by prioritizing human-actionable tasks and clearing agent backlogs.

## Strategic Priorities (This Cycle)

| Priority | Goal | Owner | Success Metric |
|----------|------|-------|----------------|
| P0 | Commit all uncommitted files | Human/CLI | 58 files → 0 files uncommitted |
| P1 | Clear Curator backlog | Curator | 15 → 0 strategy files in inbox |
| P1 | Process Testing backlog | Testing | 7 → 3 tasks remaining |
| P2 | Start Connected Services UI | Website | Frontend component skeleton created |

---

## Task Matrix

| Task ID | Task | Agent | Priority | Effort | Dependencies |
|---------|------|-------|----------|--------|--------------|
| T0 | Commit uncommitted work | Human | P0 | Low | None |
| T1 | Process & archive Curator inbox | Curator | P1 | Medium | T0 (ideally) |
| T2 | Run accordion sidebar tests | Testing | P1 | Low | None |
| T3 | Validate UploadThing integration | Testing | P1 | Medium | None |
| T4 | Create Connected Services UI | Website | P2 | High | None |
| T5 | Create CODING_STANDARDS.md | Documentation | P3 | Low | None |
| T6 | Update deployment guides | Documentation | P3 | Medium | None |

---

## Resource Allocation

| Agent | Tasks Assigned | Total Effort | Notes |
|-------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| Human | T0 | Low | Manual git commit required |
| Curator | T1 | Medium | Clear 15 pending strategies |
| Testing | T2, T3 | Medium | 2 tasks (under max of 2) |
| Website | T4 | High | Single high-effort task |
| Documentation | T5, T6 | Medium | 2 tasks (under max of 2) |

## Dependencies Map

```
T0 (Commit) ───┐
               ├──▶ T1 (Curator) ──▶ Enables future strategy distribution
               │
T2 (Testing) ──┤
               │──▶ Parallel execution (no blockers)
T3 (Testing) ──┤
               │
T4 (Website) ──┤
               │
T5 (Docs) ─────┤
               │
T6 (Docs) ─────┘
```

**Critical Path**: T0 must complete first to establish clean git state. All other tasks can run in parallel.

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Human unavailable for T0 | Medium | High | CLI Agent can also commit via automation |
| Curator doesn't process inbox | Medium | Medium | Archive old files, keep only recent 3 |
| Testing tasks take too long | Low | Low | Tasks are well-scoped, tests already written |
| Website task blocked by design | Low | Medium | Backend routes already exist |

## MoSCoW Analysis

### Must Have (P0/P1)
- ✅ Commit 58 uncommitted files
- ✅ Clear Curator inbox backlog
- ✅ Run at least 2 testing tasks

### Should Have (P2)
- ⬜ Start Connected Services UI
- ⬜ Navy theme QA review

### Could Have (P3)
- ⬜ Create CODING_STANDARDS.md
- ⬜ Update deployment guides

### Won't Have (Deferred)
- ❌ Chunked code generation (Phase 2 scope)
- ❌ User testing (needs more infrastructure)

## Success Criteria for Cycle 20

| Criterion | Target | How to Verify |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Uncommitted files | 0 | `git status --short` shows clean |
| Curator inbox | ≤3 files | `ls output/agents/curator/inbox/ \| wc -l` |
| Testing tasks completed | +2 | Check Testing Agent done/ folder |
| Strategy distributed | Yes | Curator copies to agent inboxes |
