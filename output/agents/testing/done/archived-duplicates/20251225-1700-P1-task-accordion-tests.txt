# Task: Complete Accordion UI Tests

Priority: P1
Assigned To: Testing Agent
Depends On: T0 (Commit Work) - should be complete
Estimated Effort: Medium (1 hour)
Cycle: 14 (Curated)
Quality Score: 8.6/10

---

## Context

The accordion sidebar was implemented in Cycle 10 but the Playwright test file (`configurator-accordion.spec.ts`) is incomplete. Testing is needed to validate the UI works correctly across all viewport sizes before production deployment.

---

## Objectives

1. Review existing `configurator-accordion.spec.ts`
2. Add comprehensive tests for:
   - Accordion expand/collapse functionality
   - Section content rendering
   - Mobile sidebar accordion behavior
   - Keyboard navigation (a11y)
3. Run tests and fix any failures
4. Document test results

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `configurator-accordion.spec.ts` has 5+ test cases
- [ ] All tests pass on desktop viewport (1280x720)
- [ ] All tests pass on mobile viewport (375x667)
- [ ] Test results documented in outbox
- [ ] No regressions in existing 732 tests

---

## Files to Modify

- `website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts` (enhance)

---

## Commands

```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework/website

# Run accordion tests specifically
npx playwright test configurator-accordion.spec.ts --project=chromium

# Run with UI for debugging if needed
npx playwright test configurator-accordion.spec.ts --project=chromium --ui

# Run full test suite to check for regressions
npm test
```

---

## Test Cases to Add

1. **Desktop: Accordion Opens/Closes**
   - Click section header → content expands
   - Click again → content collapses
   - Only one section open at a time (if exclusive)

2. **Desktop: Section Content Renders**
   - Each section shows correct content
   - SupabaseSetup component renders in Supabase section

3. **Mobile: Sidebar Toggle**
   - Hamburger menu opens mobile sidebar
   - Accordion sections work in mobile drawer

4. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Tab navigates between sections
   - Enter/Space opens section

5. **State Persistence**
   - Refresh page → last open section remembered (if implemented)

---

## Handoff

1. Move task to `output/agents/testing/done/`
2. Report test results to `output/agents/testing/outbox/`
3. Update TESTING_MEMORY.md with coverage notes
4. If PASS: Signal ready for production deploy
5. If FAIL: Hand off specific issues to Website Agent
