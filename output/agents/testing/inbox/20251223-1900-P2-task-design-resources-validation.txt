# Task: Verify Design Resources Load in Code Generation

**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Assigned To:** Testing Agent
**Created:** 2025-12-23 19:00
**Quality Score:** 8.8/10

## Context

Design resources system was recently implemented. This includes:
- `packages/ai-agent/src/prompts/design-quality.md` - Design quality prompt
- `templates/saas/design/tokens.json` - Design tokens for saas template

We need to verify these are being loaded correctly by the code generator.

## Vision Alignment

- **Export-First**: Design standards improve quality of exported projects
- **Transparency**: Verifies design system works as documented
- **Cursor-Native**: Ensures AI-generated code follows design guidelines

## Objectives

1. Verify design-quality.md exists in source and dist
2. Check loadDesignReference() function works
3. Confirm tokens.json exists and is valid JSON
4. Verify code generator doesn't error when loading design reference

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `packages/ai-agent/src/prompts/design-quality.md` exists
- [ ] `packages/ai-agent/dist/prompts/design-quality.md` exists after build
- [ ] `templates/saas/design/tokens.json` exists and is valid JSON
- [ ] Code generator loads design reference without errors
- [ ] Document any issues found

## Testing Approach

```bash
# 1. Verify source file exists
ls -la packages/ai-agent/src/prompts/design-quality.md

# 2. Build the package
cd packages/ai-agent && npm run build

# 3. Verify dist file exists
ls -la packages/ai-agent/dist/prompts/design-quality.md

# 4. Verify tokens.json
cat templates/saas/design/tokens.json | jq .

# 5. Check code generator for loadDesignReference
grep -n "loadDesignReference" packages/ai-agent/src/code-generator.ts
```

## Files to Review

```
packages/ai-agent/src/code-generator.ts   # loadDesignReference function
packages/ai-agent/src/prompts/design-quality.md
templates/saas/design/tokens.json
```

## Handoff

1. Create test report in `output/testing-agent/outbox/20251223-design-resources-validation.md`
2. Move task to `output/testing-agent/done/`
3. Flag any issues for Platform Agent to fix
4. Update `prompts/agents/memory/TESTING_MEMORY.md`
