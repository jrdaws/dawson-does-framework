OBJECTIVE:
----------
Complete the Vercel production deployment for the dawson-does-framework website.

PRE-WORK:
---------
```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && cat output/shared/MINDFRAME.md
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && ./scripts/check-context-freshness.sh PLT
```

CONTEXT:
--------
The website is ready for deployment. All tests pass, SOPs are in place,
and the Deployment SOP (docs/sops/DEPLOYMENT_SOP.md) should be followed.

PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:
-------------------------

### 1. Verify Tests Pass

```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && npm test
```

Expected: 693+ tests passing

### 2. Verify Build Works

```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework/website && npm run build
```

### 3. Check Environment Variables

Verify these are set in Vercel dashboard:

### 4. Follow Deployment SOP

```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && cat docs/sops/DEPLOYMENT_SOP.md
```

cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && ./scripts/certify.sh PLT "Deployment" "Live on Vercel" "good" "Production deployed"
```
