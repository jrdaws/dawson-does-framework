ADVANCED TASK: Create Shared Mindframe & Certification System
==============================================================

AGENT: Documentation Agent
PRIORITY: P0 - CRITICAL (Foundation for all agent collaboration)
DATE: 2025-12-23

VISION:
-------
Create a single "Shared Mindframe" file that serves as the collective consciousness 
of all agents - a living document that captures the certified status, health, and 
understanding of every major system component. Agents trust certifications from 
other agents, eliminating redundant verification work.

PHILOSOPHY:
-----------
"If the Auditor certified it, I trust it. If Testing signed off, it works."

Instead of every agent independently verifying the same systems, agents CERTIFY
their area of expertise, and all other agents ADOPT that certified understanding.

This creates:
- Crystal-clear shared vision
- Reduced cognitive load
- Trust-based collaboration  
- Time savings across all agents
- Single source of truth for system state

CORE CONCEPT: THE MINDFRAME FILE
---------------------------------

Create: `output/shared/MINDFRAME.md`

This file contains:

### 1. Vision & Mission Pulse
Quick snapshot of project health and direction:

```markdown
## 🎯 Project Pulse

**Overall Vibe**: 🟢 Good | 🟡 Caution | 🔴 Concern
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-23 14:30 UTC
**Updated By**: Auditor Agent

### Current Focus
[One sentence on what the project is focused on right now]

### Momentum
- Direction: [Building / Maintaining / Fixing / Planning]
- Velocity: [Fast / Steady / Slow / Blocked]
- Confidence: [High / Medium / Low]
```

### 2. Agent Certifications
Each agent certifies their domain:

Quick summaries so agents don't need to read full docs:

```markdown
## 🧠 Understanding Snapshots

### What is Dawson-Does Framework?
**TL;DR**: Build web apps visually, export to full local ownership.
**Core Philosophy**: Export-first, zero lock-in, cursor-native.
**Certified Understanding**: Auditor Agent, 2025-12-23

### How Does the Agent System Work?
**TL;DR**: 13 agents with specific roles, file-based coordination via inbox/outbox.
**Key Rule**: Always output numbered options, auto-continue on minimal input.
**Certified Understanding**: Documentation Agent, 2025-12-23

### What's the Current Priority?
**TL;DR**: Complete SOPs, verify testing, deploy to production.
**Blockers**: None
**Certified Understanding**: Strategist Agent, 2025-12-23
```

### 5. Trust Inheritance Rules

```markdown
## 🤝 Trust Inheritance

When an agent certifies something, all other agents ADOPT that certification:

| Certification Type | Certifying Agent | Other Agents Should |
|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| "Tests pass" | Testing | Trust code works, skip re-testing |
| "Governance compliant" | Auditor | Trust rules are followed |
| "Docs current" | Documentation | Trust docs match reality |
| "Build healthy" | Platform | Trust deployment readiness |
| "Assets approved" | Quality | Trust media quality |
| "Template valid" | Template | Trust export works |
| "Integration working" | Integration | Trust third-party connections |

### Certification Expiry

| Certification | Valid For | After Expiry |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| Tests passing | 24 hours | Re-run tests |
| Governance | 48 hours | Re-audit |
| Documentation | 1 week | Freshness check |
| Build health | Until code change | Re-verify |
| Assets | Until brief change | Re-review |
```

### 6. Quick Vibe Check

```markdown
## ⚡ Quick Vibe Check

For agents starting work, here's the 10-second status:

**Framework**: 🟢 Healthy
**Tests**: 🟢 All passing  
**Docs**: 🟢 Current
**Deploy**: 🟡 Pending (ready to go)
**Blockers**: None
**Mood**: Productive, building momentum

**Last Certified By**: Auditor Agent @ 2025-12-23 14:30
```

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
----------------------------

### 1. Create the Mindframe File

Create `output/shared/MINDFRAME.md` with all sections above.

### 2. Define Certification Protocol

Each agent must update their certification when:
- They complete significant work
- They verify a system is working
- They identify an issue (change vibe to 🟡 or 🔴)
- Their area of expertise changes state

### 3. Create Certification Commands

```bash
# Quick certification update
./scripts/certify.sh [agent-code] [area] [status] [vibe] "[notes]"

# Example:
./scripts/certify.sh TST "Tests" "693 passing" "good" "Full suite green"
```

### 4. Add to Agent SOPs

Every agent's role file should include:
```markdown
## Certification Responsibility

You are responsible for certifying:
- [Area 1]
- [Area 2]

Update `output/shared/MINDFRAME.md` when:
- You complete work in your area
- You discover issues
- Status changes
```

### 5. Add to Session Start

```markdown
### Step 0: Read Mindframe

Before any work:
```bash
cat output/shared/MINDFRAME.md
```

Adopt the certified understanding from other agents.
Don't re-verify things that have current certifications.
```

WHAT EACH AGENT CERTIFIES:
--------------------------

| Agent | Certifies | Vibe Responsibility |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Auditor** | Overall health, governance compliance | Project Pulse, Vibe Check |
| **Testing** | Test results, coverage, quality metrics | Tests, Lint, Build |
| **Documentation** | Doc freshness, accuracy | Documentation section |
| **Platform** | Build health, deploy readiness | Build metrics, Deploy status |
| **Website** | UI functionality, API health | Website-specific features |
| **CLI** | Command functionality | CLI commands |
| **Template** | Template validity, export success | Templates section |
| **Integration** | Third-party connections | Integrations section |
| **Quality** | Media quality, SOP compliance | Assets, SOP enforcement |
| **Research** | Brief quality, requirements clarity | Media briefs |
| **Media** | Asset generation, cost tracking | Asset generation |
| **Strategist** | Priorities, task planning | Current Focus, Priorities |
| **Curator** | Prompt quality, distribution | Agent activation readiness |

TIME-SAVERS FROM THIS SYSTEM:
-----------------------------

| Situation | Without Mindframe | With Mindframe |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Agent starts work | Re-read all docs, run tests | Glance at Mindframe, trust certs |
| Need to know test status | Run `npm test` (30s) | Check Mindframe (2s) |
| Unsure if docs current | Run freshness check | Check cert date |
| Wonder about priorities | Read multiple files | One "Current Focus" line |
| Assess overall health | Full audit (hours) | Quick Vibe Check (10s) |

DELIVERABLES:
-------------

1. ✅ `output/shared/MINDFRAME.md` - Complete shared mindframe file
2. ✅ `scripts/certify.sh` - Quick certification command
3. ✅ Update AGENT_POLICIES.md with certification responsibilities
4. ✅ Update each agent role file with their certification areas
5. ✅ Add Mindframe read to session start sequence
6. ✅ Create initial certifications (current state)

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
-----------------

□ All agents can understand system state in <30 seconds
□ Agents trust other agents' certifications
□ No redundant verification work
□ Clear vibe indicators (🟢🟡🔴)
□ Certification expiry prevents stale data
□ Single file contains shared understanding

ADVANCED CONCEPT: VIBE PROPAGATION
-----------------------------------

When one agent changes a vibe, related areas may need attention:

```
Testing vibe → 🔴 
    ↓ triggers
Platform deploy → 🔴 (can't deploy with failing tests)
    ↓ triggers  
Overall vibe → 🟡 (project health impacted)
```

Document these relationships so agents know when to update.

HANDOFF:
--------

When complete:
1. Move this file to output/documentation-agent/done/
2. Populate initial Mindframe with current state
3. Test the certify script

## Quick Actions (reply with number, or just press Enter to continue):

1. Documentation Agent: Create the Mindframe system now ← DEFAULT
2. Auditor Agent: Perform initial certification of current state
3. Read this prompt: `cat output/documentation-agent/inbox/TASK-shared-mindframe-system.txt`
4. Check project priorities: `cat output/shared/PROJECT_PRIORITIES.md`
5. No further action needed

**⏱️ Auto-continue**: If no response, proceed with Option 1
