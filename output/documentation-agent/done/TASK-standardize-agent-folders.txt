ADVANCED TASK: Standardize All Agent Folder Structures
=======================================================
AGENT: Documentation Agent
PRIORITY: P1 - HIGH
DATE: 2025-12-24

OBJECTIVE:
----------
Audit and fix all agent folder structures to match the standard defined in
docs/sops/AGENT_FOLDER_STRUCTURE_SOP.md. Remove inconsistencies and ensure
every agent has exactly: inbox/, outbox/, done/, workspace/

CURRENT ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
--------------------------
1. Some agents have BOTH `completed/` AND `done/` folders (CLI, Platform, Template)
2. Some agents have `processed/` instead of `done/` (Testing)
3. Inconsistent folder names across the framework
4. Some workspace/ folders may be missing

REQUIRED ACTIONS:
-----------------

### 1. Audit Current Structure

Run this command to identify issues:

```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework

echo "=== FOLDER AUDIT ==="

# Check executor agents
for agent in cli-agent website-agent documentation-agent testing-agent platform-agent template-agent integration-agent; do
  echo ""
  echo "--- $agent ---"
  ls -la output/$agent/ 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT FOUND"
done

# Check controller agents
for agent in auditor strategist curator; do
  echo ""
  echo "--- controller: $agent ---"
  ls -la output/controller-agents/$agent/ 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT FOUND"
done

# Check media pipeline agents
for agent in research-agent media-agent quality-agent; do
  echo ""
  echo "--- media: $agent ---"
  ls -la output/media-pipeline/$agent/ 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT FOUND"
done
```

### 2. Fix Inconsistencies

For each agent, ensure exactly these folders exist:
- inbox/
- outbox/
- done/
- workspace/

Remove or merge:
- `completed/` → merge into `done/`
- `processed/` → merge into `done/`
- Any other non-standard folders

```bash
# Example fix commands:

# Merge completed/ into done/
mv output/cli-agent/completed/* output/cli-agent/done/ 2>/dev/null
rmdir output/cli-agent/completed 2>/dev/null

# Merge processed/ into done/
mv output/testing-agent/processed/* output/testing-agent/done/ 2>/dev/null
rmdir output/testing-agent/processed 2>/dev/null

# Create missing workspace/
mkdir -p output/cli-agent/workspace
```

### 3. Verify Standard Structure

After fixes, all agents should pass this check:

```bash
for agent_path in output/cli-agent output/website-agent output/documentation-agent \
  output/testing-agent output/platform-agent output/template-agent output/integration-agent \
  output/controller-agents/auditor output/controller-agents/strategist output/controller-agents/curator \
  output/media-pipeline/research-agent output/media-pipeline/media-agent output/media-pipeline/quality-agent; do
  
  echo ""
  echo "=== $(basename $agent_path) ==="
  
  ALL_GOOD=true
  for folder in inbox outbox done workspace; do
    if [ -d "$agent_path/$folder" ]; then
      echo "  ✅ $folder"
    else
      echo "  ❌ $folder (MISSING)"
      ALL_GOOD=false
    fi
  done
  
  # Check for non-standard folders
  for folder in $(ls -d $agent_path/*/ 2>/dev/null | xargs -n1 basename); do
    case $folder in
      inbox|outbox|done|workspace|media-*) ;; # Expected folders
      *) echo "  ⚠️  NON-STANDARD: $folder" ;;
    esac
  done
done
```

### 4. Update Governance

Ensure AGENT_POLICIES.md includes the new rule about prompt management:

1. When creating a prompt for another agent:
   - Save .txt file to target agent's inbox/
   - Output fenced prompt in response
   - Include file path

2. When completing a prompt:
   - MOVE .txt file from inbox/ to done/
   - ONE location only - no duplicates

3. During checkpoint:
   - List all pending prompts with file paths

DELIVERABLES:
-------------
1. ✅ All agents have standard folder structure
2. ✅ Removed duplicate folders (completed/, processed/)
3. ✅ docs/sops/AGENT_FOLDER_STRUCTURE_SOP.md exists and is current
4. ✅ AGENT_POLICIES.md updated with prompt file rules

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
-----------------
□ All 13 agents have exactly: inbox/, outbox/, done/, workspace/
□ No non-standard folders exist
□ All prompts follow one-location rule
□ Governance updated with new rules

HANDOFF:
--------
When complete:
1. Move this file to output/documentation-agent/done/
2. Create verification report in outbox/
3. Create handoff prompt for Auditor to verify compliance

## Quick Actions (reply with number):

1. **Documentation Agent**: Execute this task now ← DEFAULT
2. **Auditor Agent**: Audit folder compliance
3. Read SOP: `cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && cat docs/sops/AGENT_FOLDER_STRUCTURE_SOP.md`
4. No further action needed

**⏱️ Auto-continue**: If no response in 35 minutes, proceed with Option 1
