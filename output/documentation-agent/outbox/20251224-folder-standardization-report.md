## Fixes Applied

| Agent | Issue | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| curator | Had `approved/` folder | Merged contents into `done/`, removed folder |

---

## Non-Standard Folders Removed

- `output/controller-agents/curator/approved/` → merged into `done/`

---

## Standard Structure

All agents now follow this structure:

```
output/{agent-name}/
├── inbox/      # Pending tasks
├── outbox/     # Completed work artifacts  
├── done/       # Completed task files
└── workspace/  # Working files
```

---

## Verification Command

Run this to verify compliance at any time:

```bash
for agent_path in output/cli-agent output/website-agent output/documentation-agent \
  output/testing-agent output/platform-agent output/template-agent output/integration-agent \
  output/controller-agents/auditor output/controller-agents/strategist output/controller-agents/curator \
  output/media-pipeline/research-agent output/media-pipeline/media-agent output/media-pipeline/quality-agent; do
  
  echo "=== $(basename $agent_path) ==="
  for folder in inbox outbox done workspace; do
    [ -d "$agent_path/$folder" ] && echo "  ✅ $folder" || echo "  ❌ $folder"
  done
done
```

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Task file moved to `output/documentation-agent/done/`
2. ✅ This report saved to `output/documentation-agent/outbox/`
3. Governance docs should be updated to reflect standard structure rules
