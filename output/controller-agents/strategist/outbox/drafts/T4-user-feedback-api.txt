# Task: User Feedback API

Priority: P2
Assigned To: Website Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Medium

## Context
Production deployment is imminent. We need a mechanism to collect user feedback on AI generation quality so we can iterate in Phase 2. This should be a simple, non-blocking feedback collection point.

## Objectives
1. Create API endpoint for feedback submission
2. Store feedback in Supabase (or file for MVP)
3. Add simple feedback UI after generation completes
4. Include generation metadata with feedback (tier, duration, file count)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] POST /api/feedback endpoint accepts feedback payload
- [ ] Feedback stored persistently
- [ ] Simple "thumbs up/down + comment" UI after generation
- [ ] Generation metadata captured with feedback

## Files to Modify
- website/app/api/feedback/route.ts (create)
- website/components/generation/FeedbackWidget.tsx (create)
- website/lib/supabase/schema.sql (add feedback table)

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Document feedback schema in outbox/
3. Update WEBSITE_MEMORY.md
