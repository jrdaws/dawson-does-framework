# Task: UploadThing End-to-End Validation

Priority: P1
Assigned To: Testing Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Medium

## Context
The UploadThing storage integration was completed last cycle. Before marking Phase 1 as truly complete, we must validate the integration works in a real exported project - not just in the template directory.

## Objectives
1. Export a SaaS project with UploadThing integration enabled
2. Verify the exported project builds without errors
3. Validate UploadThing routes and components are correctly scaffolded
4. Confirm environment variables are properly templated

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Exported project with UploadThing builds successfully (npm run build)
- [ ] Route handler exists at app/api/uploadthing/route.ts
- [ ] Component imports resolve correctly
- [ ] .env.example contains UPLOADTHING_SECRET and UPLOADTHING_APP_ID

## Files to Modify
- tests/integrations/uploadthing.test.mjs (create)
- Output project in test-output/

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Write validation report to outbox/
3. Update TESTING_MEMORY.md
