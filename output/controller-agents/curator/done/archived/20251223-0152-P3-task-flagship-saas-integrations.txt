# Task: Add Integrations to Flagship-SaaS Template

Priority: P3
Assigned To: Template Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Medium

## Context
Template quality audit noted flagship-saas has no bundled integrations,
making it hard to differentiate from basic saas template. Per audit
recommendation, add integrations to make it a more complete premium starter.

The saas template has these integrations available:
- auth (supabase, clerk)
- db (supabase, planetscale)
- payments (stripe, paddle)
- email (resend, sendgrid)
- analytics (plausible, posthog)
- ai (openai, anthropic)
- storage (uploadthing)

## Objectives
1. Create integrations directory structure in flagship-saas
2. Copy these integrations from saas template:
   - auth/supabase (primary auth)
   - db/supabase (primary database)
   - payments/stripe (primary payments)
   - email/resend (transactional email)
   - storage/uploadthing (file uploads)
3. Update template.json with supported integrations list
4. Update README with integration setup instructions
5. Verify build succeeds with all integrations applied

## Success Criteria
- [ ] flagship-saas/integrations/ directory created with 5 integrations
- [ ] Each integration has valid integration.json
- [ ] template.json lists all 5 supported integrations
- [ ] npm run build passes in flagship-saas
- [ ] README.md updated with integration instructions
- [ ] .env.example includes all integration env vars

## Files to Copy From saas Template
- templates/saas/integrations/auth/supabase/
- templates/saas/integrations/db/supabase/
- templates/saas/integrations/payments/stripe/
- templates/saas/integrations/email/resend/
- templates/saas/integrations/storage/uploadthing/

## Files to Modify
- templates/flagship-saas/template.json (add integrations array)
- templates/flagship-saas/README.md (add integrations section)
- templates/flagship-saas/.env.example (add integration vars)

## Handoff
