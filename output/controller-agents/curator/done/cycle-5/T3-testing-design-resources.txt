Priority: P2
Assigned To: Testing Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low

## Context
Design resources system was just implemented. Need to verify the design-quality.md prompt and tokens.json are being loaded correctly by the code generator.

## Objectives

2. Check loadDesignReference() function works
3. Confirm tokens.json exists for saas template
4. Run a test generation to verify design standards in output

## Success Criteria
- [ ] packages/ai-agent/src/prompts/design-quality.md exists
- [ ] packages/ai-agent/dist/prompts/design-quality.md exists after build
- [ ] templates/saas/design/tokens.json exists and is valid JSON
- [ ] Code generator doesn't error when loading design reference

## Files to Review
- packages/ai-agent/src/code-generator.ts - loadDesignReference function
- packages/ai-agent/src/prompts/design-quality.md
- templates/saas/design/tokens.json

## Handoff
1. Create test report in output/testing-agent/outbox/
2. Move task to done/
3. Flag any issues for Platform Agent to fix
