TASK: SOP Guardian Role + Sequence Oversight
=============================================

AGENT: Auditor Agent
PRIORITY: P1 - HIGH
DATE: 2025-12-23
FROM: Documentation Agent

OBJECTIVE:
----------
1. Adopt SOP Guardian responsibility (oversight role)
2. Review memory for SOP opportunities
3. Implement sequence oversight protocol
4. Establish certification requirements for agent handoffs

PRE-WORK:
---------
```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && cat output/shared/MINDFRAME.md
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && ./scripts/check-context-freshness.sh AUD
```

NEW RESPONSIBILITIES:
---------------------

### 1. SOP Guardian (Oversight Role)

As Auditor Agent, you have OVERSIGHT responsibility for SOPs:

| Responsibility | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| **Review proposed SOPs** | Quality Agent and Testing Agent propose, you approve |
| **Audit SOP compliance** | Check if agents are following existing SOPs |
| **Identify systemic gaps** | Patterns across multiple agents = SOP needed |
| **Certify SOP quality** | Sign off that an SOP is complete and correct |
| **Enforce SOP updates** | Flag stale SOPs that need refresh |

### 2. Sequence Oversight Protocol (NEW SOP RULE)

**You are the authority on correct sequencing. When reviewing work:**

```markdown
## Sequence Audit

Task being reviewed: [Task name]
Agent who completed it: [Agent]

Prerequisite Check:
- [ ] Was MINDFRAME.md read first?
- [ ] Were dependencies certified?
- [ ] Was correct agent assigned?

Sequence Violations Found:
- [List any issues]

**Sequence Compliance**: ✅ Correct / ⚠️ Violation Found
```

**When you find a sequence violation:**
1. DOCUMENT: Log the violation in your audit report
2. NOTIFY: Tell the user which agent should have gone first
3. RECOMMEND: Provide the correct prompt for the correct agent
4. CERTIFY: Once corrected, certify the sequence is now correct

### 3. Certification Requirements Matrix

Create and maintain this matrix:

| Task Type | Requires Certification From | Before |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------|
| Deployment | Testing Agent (tests pass) | Platform Agent deploys |
| Feature Release | Testing + Documentation | Announcement |
| SOP Creation | Documentation Agent | All agents use it |
| Template Update | Template Agent + Testing | Export to users |
| Media Assets | Quality Agent | Template/Website integration |
| Code Changes | Testing Agent | Merge to main |

### 4. Memory Review for SOP Opportunities

```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && cat prompts/agents/memory/AUDITOR_MEMORY.md
```

Review your previous audit sessions and identify:
- Recurring compliance issues → Need SOP
- Common agent confusion → Need clearer SOP
- Frequent sequence violations → Need enforcement SOP
- Cross-agent coordination problems → Need handoff SOP

SEQUENCE OVERSIGHT EXAMPLES:
----------------------------

**Example 1 - Catching a Violation:**
```
User sends deployment task to Platform Agent.
Platform Agent checks MINDFRAME.md, sees Tests not recently certified.

Platform Agent: "⚠️ Sequence Issue: Tests need certification first."

Auditor (on review): "Correct catch. Sequence violation prevented.
Certification matrix followed. ✅"
```

**Example 2 - Recommending Correction:**
```
User: "Quality Agent, approve these assets"
Quality Agent starts review, but notices Research Agent brief is incomplete.

Quality Agent: "⚠️ Brief incomplete. Should go back to Research Agent."

Auditor (on review): "Correct sequence enforcement. Quality Agent
properly redirected to Research Agent. Logging as best practice."
```

**Example 3 - Creating a Redirect Prompt:**
```
User sends wrong task to wrong agent.

Agent: "⚠️ Sequence Issue: This task requires [Other Agent] first.

## Redirect to: [Other Agent]

```
Confirm you are the [Other Agent].
[Corrected task description]
```

I can continue with [what's possible] while waiting, or pause entirely."
```

AUDIT TASKS:
------------

### 1. Review Current MINDFRAME Certifications

```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && cat output/shared/MINDFRAME.md
```

Check for:
- Stale certifications (>24 hours for tests, >48 hours for governance)
- Missing certifications
- Conflicting vibes (🟢 in one area but 🔴 in dependent area)

### 2. Review SOP Opportunities Log

```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && cat output/media-pipeline/quality-agent/workspace/sop-opportunities.md
```

Approve or prioritize pending SOP proposals.

### 3. Check Your Memory for Patterns

```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && cat prompts/agents/memory/AUDITOR_MEMORY.md
```

Look for:
- Repeated issues across audits
- Common agent mistakes
- Process gaps

### 4. Create Certification Requirements SOP

If not exists, create:
```
docs/sops/CERTIFICATION_REQUIREMENTS_SOP.md
```

Document which certifications are required before which actions.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
-----------------

□ SOP Guardian (oversight) responsibility acknowledged
□ Memory reviewed for audit patterns
□ Sequence oversight protocol understood
□ Certification requirements matrix created/verified
□ At least 1 SOP opportunity identified from audit history
□ MINDFRAME.md updated with Auditor certification

WHEN COMPLETE:
--------------

1. Move this file to output/controller-agents/auditor/done/
2. Update MINDFRAME.md with governance certification
3. Log any SOP opportunities found
4. Output numbered quick-select options

```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && ./scripts/certify.sh AUD "Governance" "Sequence oversight active" "good" "Certification matrix enforced"
```
