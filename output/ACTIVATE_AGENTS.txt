## Legacy Task Cleanup Needed

The following inbox folders have duplicate tasks from Cycles 11-14:
- output/cli-agent/inbox/ (4 versions of commit task)
- output/testing-agent/inbox/ (12 tasks, many duplicates)
- output/website-agent/inbox/ (4 versions of services UI)
- output/documentation-agent/inbox/ (13+ tasks, many duplicates)

Recommend archiving older versions after current cycle tasks execute.
