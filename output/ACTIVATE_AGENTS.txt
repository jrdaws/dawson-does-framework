# ACTIVATE EXECUTOR AGENTS - Cycle 16

> **Status**: GOVERNANCE PAUSED - Activate executors NOW
> **Updated**: 2025-12-25 19:00 NZDT
> **Curator**: CURATOR Agent

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: EXECUTION GAP = 5+ CYCLES

Governance agents have been cycling for 5+ cycles with ZERO executor tasks completed.
DO NOT run another Auditor/Strategist/Curator cycle until at least 3 executor tasks complete.

---

## ACTIVATION SEQUENCE

### STEP 1: CLI Agent (5 min) - P0 URGENT

Open new Cursor tab, paste this:

```
Read prompts/agents/roles/CLI.md and execute task T0 from Cycle 16 strategy. 
Commit all uncommitted work and push to origin/main. This is P0 priority.
```

### STEP 2: Testing Agent (30 min) - P1

After T0 completes, open new Cursor tab:

```
Read prompts/agents/roles/TESTING.md and execute task T1 from Cycle 16 strategy.
Complete the accordion UI tests in website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts.
Verify the new sidebar accordion behavior works correctly. Run npm test to confirm.
```

### STEP 3: Website Agent (60 min) - P2

After T1 completes (or in parallel if confident):

```
Read prompts/agents/roles/WEBSITE.md and execute task T2 from Cycle 16 strategy.
Create the Connected Services UI component for the configurator.
Backend routes are ready at website/app/api/services/connected/.
Integrate into the accordion sidebar. Follow 5DS dark theme design.
```

### STEP 4: Testing Agent (30 min) - P2 (Parallel OK)

Can run parallel to T2:

```
Read prompts/agents/roles/TESTING.md and execute task T3 from Cycle 16 strategy.
Create E2E tests for Supabase OAuth flow in website/tests/supabase-oauth.spec.ts.
Reference the UploadThing E2E tests for mock patterns. Test OAuth initiation, 
callback handling, and connected services integration.
```

### STEP 5: Documentation Agent (40 min) - P3

Lower priority, can run after T0-T3:

```
Read prompts/agents/roles/DOCUMENTATION.md and execute tasks T4 and T5 from Cycle 16 strategy.
T4: Create docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md
T5: Create docs/deploy/vercel.md and docs/deploy/netlify.md
```
