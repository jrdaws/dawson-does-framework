## Context

The UploadThing storage integration was added in commits dd95924 and 1ad8d63. This is the **first storage integration** in the framework. Before we can confidently recommend it to users, we need to verify the integration files are complete and functional.

## Vision Alignment

- **Export-First**: Validates integration works fully in exported projects
- **Zero Lock-In**: Ensures no hidden platform dependencies
- **Transparency**: Verifies clear file structure and configuration

## Objectives

1. Verify integration.json is valid and complete
2. Check all required files exist (route.ts, core.ts, file-upload.tsx, lib/uploadthing.ts)
3. Validate TypeScript compiles without errors
4. Test that component imports work correctly
5. Verify environment variable documentation is complete

## Success Criteria

- [ ] integration.json passes schema validation (contains name, type, dependencies, envVars, files)
- [ ] All 7 integration files present and valid TypeScript/JSON
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds with `npx tsc --noEmit` in templates/saas
- [ ] Component can be imported without errors
- [ ] package.json lists correct dependencies (uploadthing, @uploadthing/react)
- [ ] .env.example or docs document UPLOADTHING_TOKEN/UPLOADTHING_SECRET

## Files to Review

```
templates/saas/integrations/storage/uploadthing/
├── integration.json
├── package.json
├── lib/uploadthing.ts
├── app/api/uploadthing/core.ts
├── app/api/uploadthing/route.ts
└── components/storage/file-upload.tsx
```

Also check:
- `docs/integrations/storage/uploadthing.md` - Documentation exists and is accurate

## Testing Approach

```bash
# 1. Verify files exist
ls -la templates/saas/integrations/storage/uploadthing/

# 2. Validate JSON
cat templates/saas/integrations/storage/uploadthing/integration.json | jq .

# 3. Check TypeScript (from templates/saas)
cd templates/saas && npx tsc --noEmit

# 4. Verify documentation
cat docs/integrations/storage/uploadthing.md | head -50
```

## Handoff

1. Create test report in `output/testing-agent/outbox/20251223-uploadthing-validation.md`
2. Move this task to `output/testing-agent/done/`
3. Flag any issues for Integration Agent to fix
4. Update `prompts/agents/memory/TESTING_MEMORY.md`
