## Context

Phase 1 is complete. 668 tests passing. Now we need production smoke tests to verify the deployed website works correctly.

## Task Objectives

1. **Smoke Test Suite**
   - Create lightweight smoke test suite for production
   - Test critical user paths only
   - Should complete in < 30 seconds

2. **Critical Paths to Test**
   - Homepage loads correctly
   - Configure page renders (no React errors)
   - Project generation API responds (mock or real)
   - Export flow works

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Add smoke test step to deployment workflow
   - Run after successful deployment
   - Alert on failure

4. **Health Endpoints**
   - Create `/api/health` endpoint for monitoring
   - Return service status and version

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Smoke test suite created (`website/tests/smoke/`)
- [ ] Can run against production URL
- [ ] Health endpoint implemented
- [ ] Documentation for running smoke tests

## Files to Create/Modify

- `website/tests/smoke/production.spec.ts` - Smoke tests (new)
- `website/app/api/health/route.ts` - Health endpoint (new)
- `.github/workflows/smoke-tests.yml` - CI workflow (new)

## Handoff

When complete:
1. Move this file to `output/testing-agent/done/`
2. Create completion report in `output/testing-agent/outbox/`
3. Notify Platform Agent that smoke tests are ready
