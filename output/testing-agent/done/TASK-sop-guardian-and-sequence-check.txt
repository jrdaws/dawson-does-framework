TASK: SOP Guardian Role + Sequence Verification
================================================

AGENT: Testing Agent
PRIORITY: P1 - HIGH
DATE: 2025-12-23
FROM: Documentation Agent

OBJECTIVE:
----------
1. Adopt SOP Guardian responsibility (shared with Quality Agent)
2. Review memory for SOP opportunities
3. Implement sequence verification protocol
4. Verify SOPs are actionable

PRE-WORK:
---------
```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && cat output/shared/MINDFRAME.md
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && ./scripts/check-context-freshness.sh TST
```

NEW RESPONSIBILITIES:
---------------------

### 1. SOP Guardian (Shared with Quality Agent)

As Testing Agent, you are NOW responsible for:

| Responsibility | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| **Identify SOP gaps** | During testing, note undocumented processes |
| **Propose new SOPs** | Log to sop-opportunities.md when pattern seen 3+ times |
| **Update existing SOPs** | If you find an SOP is inaccurate, update it |
| **Verify SOPs work** | Test SOPs are actually actionable |

### 2. Sequence Verification Protocol (NEW SOP RULE)

**Before starting any task, verify you're in the correct sequence:**

```markdown
## Sequence Check

Current task: [Task name]
Expected sequence position: [Where this fits]
Prerequisites completed:
- [ ] [Previous agent] certified [area]? Check MINDFRAME.md
- [ ] Dependencies met?

**Sequence Status**: ✅ Correct / ⚠️ Out of Order
```

**If out of sequence:**
1. NOTIFY the user: "⚠️ Sequence Issue: This task should wait for [Agent] to complete [Task] first."
2. RECOMMEND: "Suggest sending this prompt to [Agent] for [action] first."
3. OFFER: "I can proceed with what's possible now, or wait. Your choice."
4. If user says continue, proceed with available work.

### 3. Memory Review for SOP Opportunities

```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && cat prompts/agents/memory/TESTING_MEMORY.md
```

Review your previous sessions and identify:
- Repeated testing patterns that aren't documented
- Common issues that could be prevented with an SOP
- Processes you follow that other agents should know

Log findings to:
```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && cat output/media-pipeline/quality-agent/workspace/sop-opportunities.md
```

SEQUENCE VERIFICATION EXAMPLES:
-------------------------------

**Example 1 - Correct Sequence:**
```
User sends: "Test the new feature"
Testing Agent checks MINDFRAME.md:
- Code Quality: ✅ Certified by Testing (me) - 2 hours ago
- Documentation: ✅ Current
- Deployment: 🟡 Pending

Response: "✅ Sequence correct. I can test this now."
```

**Example 2 - Out of Sequence:**
```
User sends: "Deploy to production"
Testing Agent checks MINDFRAME.md:
- Tests: ❌ Not recently certified
- Documentation: 🟡 Needs review

Response: "⚠️ Sequence Issue: Deployment should wait for:
1. Testing Agent to verify tests pass
2. Documentation Agent to confirm docs current

Recommend: Send this prompt to Testing first:
[Prompt for Testing Agent]

Would you like me to run tests now instead, or proceed with what's possible?"
```

VERIFICATION TASKS:
-------------------

### 1. Verify SOPs Are Actionable

```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && cat docs/sops/BUG_TRIAGE_SOP.md
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && cat docs/sops/DEPLOYMENT_SOP.md
```

Create a sample bug report to test the Bug Triage SOP works.

### 2. Check Your Memory for SOP Opportunities

Look for patterns like:
- "I always check X before Y" → Could be an SOP
- "This error happens often" → Could be a troubleshooting SOP
- "Users often ask about X" → Could be a FAQ SOP

### 3. Update SOP Opportunities File

```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && cat output/media-pipeline/quality-agent/workspace/sop-opportunities.md
```

Add any new opportunities you identify.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
-----------------

□ SOP Guardian responsibility acknowledged
□ Memory reviewed for SOP opportunities
□ Sequence verification protocol understood
□ At least 1 SOP opportunity identified and logged
□ Sample bug report created (testing Bug Triage SOP)
□ MINDFRAME.md updated with Testing certification

WHEN COMPLETE:
--------------

1. Move this file to output/testing-agent/done/
2. Update MINDFRAME.md
3. Log any SOP opportunities found
4. Output numbered quick-select options

```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework && ./scripts/certify.sh TST "Code Quality" "SOPs verified + Guardian role" "good" "Sequence check protocol active"
```
