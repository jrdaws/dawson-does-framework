## Executive Summary

The Dawson-Does Framework remains stable with 732 tests passing for 9 consecutive cycles. No commits have been made in the last 6 hours, but there are 58 uncommitted files (16 modified + 13 deleted + 29 untracked) that require immediate attention. The execution gap identified in previous cycles remains a concern—governance work accumulates but tasks are not being picked up by executor agents.

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (P0)
1. **58 uncommitted files** - Governance files, reports, demos accumulating without commit for 8+ cycles
2. **Curator inbox overflow** - 15 strategy files pending in inbox, none processed

### Important Gaps (P1)
1. **Testing Agent backlog** - 7 tasks in inbox (oldest from 2025-12-23)
2. **CLI Agent inactive** - P0 commit task sitting in inbox since 2025-12-26

### Minor Gaps (P2)
1. **Documentation Agent backlog** - 5 tasks in inbox
2. **Connected Services UI** - Backend routes ready, frontend not started

---

## Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Owner | Resolution Path |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Uncommitted files | High | Human/CLI | `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: commit Cycle 19 work" && git push` |
| Execution gap | High | Human | Activate executor agents to process inboxes |
| Curator backlog | Medium | Curator | Process 15 pending strategy files |
| Vercel primary domain | Low | Human | Configure Root Dir=website in Vercel dashboard |

## Agent Inbox Summary

| Agent | Inbox Tasks | Oldest Task | Priority |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| CLI | 2 | 2025-12-26 (P0 commit) | P0 |

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

### Priority 0 (Immediate)
1. **Commit 58 uncommitted files NOW**
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "chore: commit Cycle 19 governance work, demos, and reports" && git push
   ```

### Priority 1 (Must Do)
1. **Process Curator inbox** - 15 strategy files need distribution or archiving
2. **Clear Testing backlog** - 7 tasks, oldest 4 days old
3. **Activate CLI Agent** - P0 commit task waiting

### Priority 2 (Should Do)
1. **Connected Services UI** - Backend ready, create frontend
2. **Run accordion sidebar tests**
3. **Complete Navy theme QA report review**

### Priority 3 (Could Do)
1. **Create CODING_STANDARDS.md** - Documentation task pending
2. **Archive old Curator inbox files** - 12 files from 2025-12-23/24
