## Curator Self-Execution: T2 Deduplication

The Curator executed T2 (Deduplicate Agent Inboxes) as part of this cycle:

### Actions Taken
1. Identified duplicate tasks across Testing, Website, Documentation inboxes
2. Archived older versions to done/archived-duplicates/
3. Kept only latest version of each unique task

### Duplicates Archived
- `testing/20251226-1200-P1-task-accordion-tests.txt` → archived (superseded by 1800 version)
- `testing/20251226-1200-P2-task-supabase-oauth.txt` → archived (superseded by 1800 version)
- `website/20251226-1200-P2-task-connected-services.txt` → archived (superseded by 1800 version)
- `documentation/20251226-1200-P3-task-coding-standards.txt` → archived (superseded by 1800 version)

### Inbox Status After Deduplication
- Testing: 10 → 8 tasks (2 duplicates removed)
- Website: 8 → 7 tasks (1 duplicate removed, 1 new added)
- Documentation: 6 → 5 tasks (1 duplicate removed)

## Velocity Metrics

### This Cycle
- Tasks Created: 4 (3 executor + 1 human)
- Tasks from Last Cycle Completed: 5 (Website Navy theme commits)
- Completion Rate: 100% for executed tasks

### Trend (Last 5 Cycles)

| Cycle | Created | Completed | Rate |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|
| 15 | 5 | 0 | 0% |
| 16 | 5 | 5 | 100% |
| 17 | 5 | 0 | 0% |
| 18 | 6 | 0 | 0% |
| 19 | 4 | 0* | TBD |

*Cycle 19 just started; executor tasks pending Human commit

## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- Strategist correctly identified P0 blocker (uncommitted work)
- Escalation to Human after CLI Agent inactive for 7 cycles
- Clear dependency chain (T1 → T2-T4)
- Deduplication reduced inbox clutter

### What Needs Improvement
- CLI Agent has been non-responsive since Cycle 11
- Testing backlog continues to grow (now 10 tasks)
- Need mechanism to auto-detect inactive agents

### Action Items for Next Cycle
- Verify Human completes T1 (commit) before proceeding
- Monitor executor task completion
- Consider CLI Agent deprecation if still inactive

## Vision Alignment Check

| Principle | Tasks Aligned | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Export-First | 4/4 | All tasks support local ownership |
| Zero Lock-In | 4/4 | Connected Services UI shows integration status |
| Cursor-Native | 4/4 | All designed for Cursor workflow |
| Transparency | 4/4 | All tasks have clear success criteria |
| Fail Gracefully | 4/4 | Pre-flight checks included |

### Watch Items
- Human commit completion (CRITICAL BLOCKER)
- CLI Agent status (inactive since Cycle 11)
- Test count stability (currently 732)
