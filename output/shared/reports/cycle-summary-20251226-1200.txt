## Velocity Metrics

### This Cycle
- Tasks Created: 6
- Tasks from Last Cycle Completed: 5 (Website Agent Navy theme work)
- Completion Rate: 83% (5/6 tasks from Cycle 16)

### Trend (Last 5 Cycles)

| Cycle | Created | Completed | Rate |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|
| 13 | 6 | 0 | 0% |
| 14 | 6 | 0 | 0% |
| 15 | 0 | 0 | - |
| 16 | 6 | 0 | 0% |
| 17 | 6 | 5 | 83% |

**Observation**: Execution gap BROKEN! Website Agent completed 5+ Navy theme tasks. First positive completion rate since Cycle 12.

---

## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- Navy theme implementation by Website Agent showed significant velocity
- 5 commits in 6 hours demonstrates active execution
- Quality Agent produced valuable QA report
- All 732 tests remain passing (stability maintained)

### What Needs Improvement
- 4 files remain uncommitted (blocking others)
- Testing Agent backlog continues to grow (11 tasks)
- Still 35+ total tasks across inboxes

### Action Items for Next Cycle
- Prioritize P0 commit task before anything else
- Consider activating Testing Agent immediately after commit
- Monitor if Connected Services UI creates more follow-on work

## Vision Alignment Check

| Principle | Tasks Aligned | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Export-First | 6/6 | All tasks serve local ownership |
| Zero Lock-In | 6/6 | No platform dependencies added |
| Cursor-Native | 6/6 | All executable in Cursor environment |
| Transparency | 6/6 | All tasks have clear handoffs |
| Fail Gracefully | 5/6 | T5 (OAuth) needs error handling tests |

**Trigger**: Auditor reads new commits and test results

### Carry-Forward Items
- Testing Agent backlog (now 13 tasks in inbox)
- Website Agent remaining tasks (now 10 in inbox)

### Watch Items
- P0 commit task must complete before dependent tasks
- OAuth E2E depends on Connected Services UI
- Monitor test count (should increase with accordion tests)
