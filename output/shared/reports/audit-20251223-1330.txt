## Progress Assessment

### Goals Met
- [x] Automation infrastructure created (Keyboard Maestro, shell scripts)
- [x] Smart auto-cycle with Cursor primary, CLI backup
- [x] Continuous improvement system operational (AUDITOR/STRATEGIST/CURATOR)
- [x] UploadThing storage integration added
- [x] 3 improvement cycles completed successfully

### Goals In Progress
- [ ] Production deployment to Vercel - 90% (prep complete, execution pending)
- [ ] User testing - 0% (waiting for deployment)

### Goals Not Started
- [ ] Chunked code generation for complex projects
- [ ] Visual code editing in browser

---

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (P1)
1. **Production not deployed** - All prep is done, but actual deployment hasn't executed yet

### Important Gaps (P2)
1. **No payment integration tests** - Stripe/Paddle webhooks not tested in production
2. **Automation not scheduled** - Keyboard Maestro macro created but not time-triggered

### Minor Gaps (P3)
1. **Hammerspoon not installed** - Alternative automation tool mentioned but not set up
2. **Velocity metrics incomplete** - Only 3 cycles recorded in velocity-log.csv

---

## Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Owner | Resolution Path |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Vercel deployment requires human action | Med | Human | Execute deployment via Vercel dashboard |
| No Anthropic API key in CI for live tests | Low | Platform | Add secret to GitHub |

---

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

### Priority 1 (Must Do)
1. **Execute Vercel deployment** - All preparation is complete, just needs execution

### Priority 2 (Should Do)
1. **Enable Keyboard Maestro time triggers** - Set up 6-hour automated cycles
2. **Test UploadThing integration** - Verify the new storage integration works

### Priority 3 (Could Do)
1. **Add velocity tracking automation** - Auto-update velocity-log.csv
2. **Create user feedback collection mechanism** - Prepare for user testing phase
