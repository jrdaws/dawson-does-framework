## Velocity Metrics

### This Cycle
- Tasks Created: 5
- Tasks from Last Cycle Completed: 5 (Website Agent - Navy theme)
- Completion Rate: ~83%

### Trend (Last 5 Cycles)

| Cycle | Created | Completed | Rate |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|
| 14 | 6 | 0 | 0% |
| 15 | 6 | 0 | 0% |
| 16 | 6 | 0 | 0% |
| 17 | 6 | 5 | 83% |
| 18 | 5 | 5 | 100% |

**Trend**: ✅ EXECUTION GAP CLOSED - Website Agent active

---

## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- Website Agent broke the execution gap with 5 Navy theme commits
- Strategy correctly identified commit blocker as P0
- Quality scores consistently above threshold (8.72 avg)

### What Needs Improvement
- CLI Agent has not executed any tasks for 6+ cycles (escalated to Human)
- Testing backlog still growing despite being high priority
- Duplicate tasks accumulating in inboxes (now cleaned)

### Action Items for Next Cycle
- Monitor Human commit execution (T1)
- Verify Testing Agent processes accordion tests (T2)
- Continue governance pause if executors don't respond

---

## Vision Alignment Check

| Principle | Tasks Aligned | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Export-First | 5/5 | All tasks support local-first ownership |
| Zero Lock-In | 5/5 | No platform-locked features |
| Cursor-Native | 5/5 | All executable in Cursor chats |
| Transparency | 5/5 | Clear prompts with full context |
| Fail Gracefully | 5/5 | Error handling included in specs |

**Trigger**: Auditor reads new commits and test results

### Carry-Forward Items
- P0 Commit (escalated to Human)
- Testing backlog items older than 48h

### Watch Items
- CLI Agent responsiveness
- Testing Agent execution rate
- Uncommitted file count (currently 24)
