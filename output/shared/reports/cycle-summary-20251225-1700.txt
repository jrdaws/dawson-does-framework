## Quality Assessment

### Approved Prompts

| Task | Vision | Clarity | Complete | Action | Scope | Total | Status |
|------|--------|---------|----------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| T0 Commit Work | 10 | 9 | 9 | 10 | 9 | **9.2** | ✅ Approved |

### Quality Criteria (1-10 each, 20% weight):
- **Vision Alignment**: Does this serve export-first, zero lock-in?
- **Clarity**: Can agent understand without asking questions?
- **Completeness**: Are all file paths, context, criteria included?
- **Actionability**: Can agent start immediately?
- **Scope**: Completable in one session?

### Rejected Prompts

| Task | Score | Reason | Disposition |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| None | - | All 6 drafts met quality threshold (≥7.0) | - |

## Inbox Cleanup Actions

**Critical**: Multiple duplicate tasks accumulated from Cycles 11-14. Recommending cleanup:

### CLI Agent Inbox
- Keep: `20251225-1600-P0-task-commit-work.txt` (latest, most complete)
- Archive: 3 older versions from 1400, 1500, 1530

### Testing Agent Inbox
- Keep: `20251225-1600-P1-task-accordion-tests.txt`
- Keep: `20251225-1600-P2-task-oauth-e2e.txt`
- Archive: 6 older versions + 3 legacy tasks from Dec 23

### Website Agent Inbox
- Keep: `20251225-1600-P2-task-connected-services-ui.txt`
- Archive: 3 older versions from 1400, 1500, 1530

### Documentation Agent Inbox
- Keep: `20251225-1600-P3-task-coding-standards.txt`
- Keep: `20251225-1600-P3-task-deployment-guides.txt`
- Archive: 10 older/duplicate tasks

## Velocity Metrics

### This Cycle
- Tasks Created: 6
- Tasks from Last Cycle Completed: 0
- Completion Rate: 0%

### Trend (Last 5 Cycles)
| Cycle | Date | Created | Completed | Rate |
|-------|------|---------|-----------|------|
| 10 | Dec 24 18:00 | 5 | 8 | 160% |
| 11 | Dec 25 02:00 | 6 | 8 | 133% |
| 12 | Dec 25 14:00 | 6 | 0 | 0% |
| 13 | Dec 25 15:30 | 6 | 0 | 0% |
| 14 | Dec 25 17:00 | 6 | 0 | 0% |

**⚠️ ALERT**: 3 consecutive cycles with 0% execution rate. This is a systemic issue.

## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- Governance cycle (Auditor → Strategist → Curator) executes smoothly
- Quality of draft prompts consistently high (8.4 avg)
- 732 tests remain stable (zero regressions)
- All 6 drafts approved without rejection

### What Needs Improvement
- **CRITICAL: Execution gap** - 3 cycles with 0 tasks executed
- Task accumulation in inboxes (30+ duplicate tasks across agents)
- No automation to trigger executor agents after curation
- P0 commit task blocking all forward progress for 3+ cycles

### Action Items for Next Cycle
1. **STOP GOVERNANCE CYCLES** until executor agents complete at least 3 tasks
2. Human must manually activate CLI, Testing, Website, Documentation agents
3. Archive/clean duplicate tasks from inboxes before next audit
4. Consider Keyboard Maestro automation for agent activation

## Vision Alignment Check

| Principle | Tasks Aligned | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Export-First | 6/6 | All tasks support local ownership goal |
| Zero Lock-In | 6/6 | No vendor dependencies introduced |
| Cursor-Native | 6/6 | All work compatible with Cursor workflow |
| Transparency | 6/6 | Clear task definitions, no magic |
| Fail Gracefully | 4/6 | T4/T5 (docs) add recovery guidance |

## Next Cycle

**Scheduled Start**: PAUSED until execution gap closes
**Condition**: Resume governance when ≥3 tasks complete

### Carry-Forward Items
- All 6 tasks from this cycle (none completed)
- Inbox cleanup needed before next audit

### Watch Items
- Uncommitted work (22 files) - now 4+ cycles overdue
- Execution gap - now 3 cycles with 0% completion
- Test stability (732 passing - monitor for regressions)

---

## Executor Launch Commands

Copy these into new Cursor chats to launch agents:

### CLI AGENT (P0 - DO FIRST)
```
Read and execute the task in output/agents/cli/inbox/20251225-1700-P0-task-commit-work.txt

This is CRITICAL - 22 files uncommitted for 4+ cycles. All other work is blocked.
```

### TESTING AGENT (P1)
```
Read and execute tasks in output/agents/testing/inbox/:
1. 20251225-1700-P1-task-accordion-tests.txt (P1)
2. 20251225-1700-P2-task-oauth-e2e.txt (P2)
```

### WEBSITE AGENT (P2)
```
Read and execute the task in output/agents/website/inbox/20251225-1700-P2-task-connected-services-ui.txt
```

### DOCUMENTATION AGENT (P3)
```
Read and execute tasks in output/agents/documentation/inbox/:
1. 20251225-1700-P3-task-coding-standards.txt
2. 20251225-1700-P3-task-deployment-guides.txt
```

## ⚠️ CURATOR RECOMMENDATION

**PAUSE GOVERNANCE CYCLES IMMEDIATELY**

The Auditor → Strategist → Curator loop is working perfectly, but executor agents are not being activated. Continuing governance cycles creates:
- More duplicate tasks in inboxes
- More uncommitted files
- More cycles without progress

**Next Human Action Required:**
1. Launch CLI Agent to commit work (5 min)
2. Launch Testing Agent for accordion tests (1 hr)
3. Launch Website Agent for connected services UI (2 hr)

Do NOT run another Auditor cycle until these complete.
