Date: 2025-12-23 23:30
Curator: CURATOR Agent
Type: Cleanup & Consolidation Cycle

## Cycle Overview

| Phase | Agent | Status | Duration |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| Check | Auditor | ⏭ Skipped | - |
| Plan | Strategist | ⏭ Skipped | - |
| Act | Curator | ✅ Complete | ~15 min |

**Note**: This was a maintenance cycle focused on inbox cleanup rather than new task creation.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Inbox Consolidation
- **12 duplicate tasks archived** to `output/controller-agents/curator/approved/archived/`
- Kept only the latest version of each task type
- Reduced inbox clutter from 20+ tasks to 10 actionable tasks

### Archived Tasks (Superseded by Newer Versions)

## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- Inbox cleanup reduced clutter significantly
- Duplicate detection prevented confusion
- Test suite remains stable (693 passing)
- Governance structure working well

### What Needs Improvement
- **No tasks being executed**: Cycle 5 tasks still sitting in inboxes
- **Human bottleneck**: Production deployment waiting for human action
- **Task accumulation**: Tasks not being picked up between cycles

### Root Cause Analysis
Tasks aren't being executed because:
1. Each cycle creates NEW tasks without executor agents being launched
2. Human must manually start executor agents by copying commands into new chats
3. No automated executor triggering exists

### Action Items for Next Cycle
1. **Launch executor agents NOW** - Don't just create tasks, execute them
2. **Consider task limits** - Don't create more tasks than can be executed
3. **Track which tasks actually get picked up**

## Vision Alignment Check

| Principle | Tasks Aligned | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Export-First | 9/9 | All tasks improve export experience |
| Zero Lock-In | 9/9 | No platform dependencies |
| Cursor-Native | 9/9 | Tasks designed for Claude execution |
| Transparency | 9/9 | All tasks have clear criteria |
| Fail Gracefully | 7/9 | Some need error handling focus |

## Files Modified

### Reports Created

### Tasks Archived
- 12 files moved to `output/controller-agents/curator/approved/archived/`

### Files Updated
- `output/ACTIVATE_AGENTS.txt`
- `output/shared/metrics/velocity-log.csv`

## Next Cycle

**Recommended**: Skip controller cycle, launch executor agents instead

The system has 9 well-defined tasks waiting for execution. Priority should be:
1. Launch Testing Agent for P1 UploadThing validation
2. Launch Platform Agent for P1 chunked code generation
3. Human executes Vercel deployment (separate from agent work)

**Next Full PDCA Cycle**: After current tasks complete (~2-4 hours)
