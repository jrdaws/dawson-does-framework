# Strategy Report

Cycle: 19
Date: 2025-12-27 00:00 (NZT)
Strategist: STRATEGIST Agent
Responding to: audit-20251226-1800.txt

---

## Strategic Priorities

Based on the Auditor's findings and current project state, this cycle focuses on:

1. **Commit All Uncommitted Work (P0)**: 54 files now (16 modified + 13 deleted + 38 untracked) - CRITICAL. Uncommitted work has TRIPLED since last audit. CLI Agent inactive for 7+ cycles. Escalate to HUMAN IMMEDIATE action.

2. **Deduplicate Agent Inboxes (P1)**: Multiple cycles have created duplicate tasks. Testing inbox has 4+ versions of accordion tests, Website has 3+ versions of connected services. This inflates metrics and causes confusion.

3. **Clear Testing Backlog (P1)**: With 13 tasks accumulated, focus on the 2 most critical: accordion sidebar tests and OAuth E2E tests.

## Task Matrix

| ID | Task | Agent | Priority | Effort | Depends On |
|----|------|-------|----------|--------|------------|
| T1 | Commit all uncommitted work (54 files) | Human | P0 | Low | None |
| T2 | Deduplicate Testing/Website inboxes | Curator | P1 | Low | T1 |
| T3 | Accordion sidebar unit tests | Testing | P1 | Medium | T1 |
| T4 | Connected services UI frontend | Website | P2 | High | T1 |
| T5 | Create CODING_STANDARDS.md | Documentation | P3 | Low | None |

---

## Dependencies Map

```
T1 (Human Commit) ─────┬──────────▶ T2 (Curator Dedup)
                       │                   
                       ├──────────▶ T3 (Accordion Tests)
                       │                   
                       └──────────▶ T4 (Services UI)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Human doesn't commit before starting other work | Medium | Critical | Make T1 blocking step, provide exact command |
| Uncommitted work causes git conflicts | High | High | Commit FIRST before any file edits |
| Testing backlog continues growing | Medium | Medium | Focus on 1 high-impact test (accordion) |
| Duplicate tasks persist | Low | Low | Curator deduplication task |

## Draft Task Prompts

### T1: Commit All Uncommitted Work (HUMAN - IMMEDIATE)

```
# Task: Commit All Uncommitted Work

Priority: P0 (CRITICAL - BLOCKING ALL OTHER WORK)
Assigned To: Human (escalated from CLI Agent after 7 cycles)
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low (2 minutes)

## Context
54 files now uncommitted (up from 24 last cycle). This includes:
- 16 modified files (governance, memory, framework map)
- 13 deleted files (archived duplicate tasks)
- 38 untracked files (new reports, design demos, task prompts)

The CLI Agent has not processed any of the 4 P0 commit tasks in its inbox since Cycle 11. This is now CRITICAL - uncommitted work has TRIPLED and risks data loss.

## Objectives
1. Stage all changes
2. Commit with descriptive message
3. Push to origin/main

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `git status` shows clean working directory
- [ ] All 54 files committed
- [ ] Changes pushed to origin/main

## Commands to Execute

cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: commit Cycle 17-18 work

- Navy theme implementation complete (buttons, cards, forms, auth)
- Design demos (sidebar-variants, light/navy/warm-sand themes)
- QA reports and memory files
- Archived duplicate inbox tasks
- Strategy and cycle summary reports
- AccordionSidebar updates"
git push origin main

## Handoff
Verify push succeeded, then proceed with Cycle 19 executor tasks.
```

### T2: Deduplicate Agent Inboxes

```
# Task: Deduplicate Agent Inboxes

Priority: P1
Assigned To: Curator Agent
Depends On: T1 (Commit must complete first)
Estimated Effort: Low

## Context
Multiple PDCA cycles have created duplicate task files:
- Testing inbox: 4 versions of accordion tests, 4 versions of OAuth E2E
- Website inbox: 3 versions of connected services UI

This inflates backlog metrics and causes executor confusion.

## Objectives
1. Scan Testing Agent inbox for duplicate tasks
2. Scan Website Agent inbox for duplicate tasks  
3. Keep only the latest version of each unique task
4. Archive older duplicates to done/archived-duplicates/

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Testing inbox reduced from 13 to <6 unique tasks
- [ ] Website inbox reduced from 10 to <4 unique tasks
- [ ] Archived tasks documented
- [ ] No unique tasks lost

## Files to Review
- output/agents/testing/inbox/ - 13 files
- output/agents/website/inbox/ - 10 files

## Handoff
1. Document what was archived in completion report
2. Move this task to done/
3. Update velocity metrics if needed
```

### T3: Accordion Sidebar Unit Tests

```
# Task: Accordion Sidebar Unit Tests

Priority: P1
Assigned To: Testing Agent
Depends On: T1 (Commit must complete first)
Estimated Effort: Medium

## Context
AccordionSidebar.tsx (713 lines) was updated for the Navy theme. The component needs test coverage to validate changes and prevent regressions. This task has been pending since Cycle 11.

## Objectives
1. Create comprehensive unit tests for AccordionSidebar
2. Test expand/collapse behavior
3. Test keyboard navigation and accessibility
4. Test Navy theme integration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Test file created at website/__tests__/components/AccordionSidebar.test.tsx
- [ ] Minimum 10 test cases
- [ ] Tests cover: expand/collapse, selection, keyboard nav, ARIA
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Test count increases (currently 732)

## Files to Create
- website/__tests__/components/AccordionSidebar.test.tsx

## Reference
- Component: website/app/components/configurator/AccordionSidebar.tsx
- Pattern: website/__tests__/components/*.test.tsx (if exists)

## Handoff
1. Run npm test to verify all pass
2. Commit: test(website): add AccordionSidebar unit tests
3. Move task to done/
4. Update TESTING_MEMORY.md
```

### T4: Connected Services UI Frontend

```
# Task: Connected Services UI Frontend

Priority: P2
Assigned To: Website Agent
Depends On: T1 (Commit must complete first)
Estimated Effort: High

## Context
Backend API routes for connected services exist. Users need a UI to view/manage their connected integrations (Supabase, UploadThing). This demonstrates platform value.

## Objectives
1. Create Connected Services dashboard page
2. Display integration status (connected/not connected)
3. Add connect/disconnect functionality
4. Apply Navy theme styling consistently

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard page at website/app/dashboard/services/page.tsx

## Files to Create
- website/app/dashboard/services/page.tsx
- website/components/dashboard/ConnectedServices.tsx

## API Endpoints (already exist)
- GET /api/user/integrations
- POST /api/user/integrations  
- DELETE /api/user/integrations/[id]

## Handoff
1. Test in local dev server
2. Verify Navy theme consistency
3. Commit: feat(website): add connected services UI
4. Move task to done/
5. Update WEBSITE_MEMORY.md
```

### T5: Create CODING_STANDARDS.md

```
# Task: Create CODING_STANDARDS.md

Priority: P3
Assigned To: Documentation Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low

## Context
AGENT_CONTEXT.md references coding conventions but no standalone CODING_STANDARDS.md exists. This document would help contributor onboarding.

## Objectives
1. Create comprehensive coding standards document
2. Document JavaScript (.mjs) conventions
3. Document TypeScript conventions
4. Document commit message format

## Success Criteria
- [ ] File created at docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md
- [ ] JavaScript section: no semicolons, 2-space indent
- [ ] TypeScript section: semicolons, 2-space indent
- [ ] Commit section: conventional format (feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:)
- [ ] Linting/formatting rules documented

## Reference Content
Extract and expand from AGENT_CONTEXT.md:
- JavaScript (.mjs): No semicolons, 2-space indent
- TypeScript (.ts/.tsx): Semicolons, 2-space indent
- Commits: Conventional format

## Handoff
1. Commit: docs(standards): create CODING_STANDARDS.md
2. Move task to done/
3. Update DOCUMENTATION_MEMORY.md
```

## Deferred Items

Tasks explicitly NOT included this cycle:
- **OAuth E2E Tests (P2)**: Depends on Connected Services UI completion
- **Supabase OAuth E2E**: Batched with accordion tests for testing load balance
- **Deployment guides**: Lower priority than P0/P1 blockers
- **Research/Media backlog**: Can wait until P0/P1 cleared
