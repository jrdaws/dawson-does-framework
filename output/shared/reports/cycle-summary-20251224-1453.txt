## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- P0 export mismatch FIXED - critical user-facing bug resolved
- UploadThing validation completed - first storage integration verified
- SaaS template significantly enhanced (dashboard, pricing, settings pages)
- Agent folder structure standardized across all 13 agents
- Execution gap from cycles 6-9 finally addressed

### What Needs Improvement
- T3 (Vercel deployment) still blocked on user authentication
- Some inbox tasks aging (design validation, integration tests)

### Blockers Resolved
| Blocker | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| P0 Export Mismatch | Fixed in commit 9d827c7 |
| UploadThing untested | Validation complete |
| Execution gap (4 cycles) | 6 tasks completed |

### Remaining Blockers
| Blocker | Owner | Resolution Path |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Vercel auth required | User | Run `vercel login` |

---

## Vision Alignment Check

| Principle | This Cycle | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Export-First | ✅ | P0 fix ensures export matches preview |
| Zero Lock-In | ✅ | Integrations scaffold without env vars |
| Cursor-Native | ✅ | All work done via agent prompts |
| Transparency | ✅ | Clear messaging in export UI |
| Fail Gracefully | ✅ | Graceful warnings for missing env vars |

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Human Action Required)
1. **Vercel Authentication**: Run `vercel login` to unblock T3

### Next Cycle Priorities
1. **T1 Verification**: Confirm export clarity changes work correctly
2. **T3 Deployment**: After user auth, deploy to Vercel production
3. **T4 Documentation**: Update deployment guides after T3

### Deferred Items
- Chunked Code Generation (Platform) - complex, defer to post-deployment
- Flagship-SaaS Integrations (Template) - P3, can wait
- User Feedback API (Website) - depends on deployment
