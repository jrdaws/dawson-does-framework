## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- Strategist provided well-structured drafts with clear objectives
- Existing task queue prevented duplicate distribution
- Merging T4 avoided fragmented documentation work
- Clear priority ordering in strategy report

### What Needs Improvement
- Production deployment needs human coordination (not AI agent task)
- Strategy report file paths referenced non-existent files
- Some drafts lacked specific file paths

### Action Items for Next Cycle
- Run Auditor to assess completed work quality
- Clear drafts folder after curation
- Track human deployment progress separately

---

## Vision Alignment Check

| Principle | Tasks Aligned | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Export-First | 8/8 | All tasks support local ownership |
| Zero Lock-In | 8/8 | Integrations designed for independence |
| Cursor-Native | 5/8 | Documentation and testing support workflow |
| Transparency | 7/8 | Testing and docs increase transparency |
| Fail Gracefully | 4/8 | Error handling in feedback API |
