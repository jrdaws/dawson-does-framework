## Quality Assessment

### Approved Prompts

| Task | Clarity | Complete | Alignment | Actionable | Scope | Total |
|------|---------|----------|-----------|------------|-------|-------|
| T0 - CLI Commit | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10.0 |
| T1 - Accordion Tests | 9 | 8 | 8 | 9 | 9 | 8.6 |
| T2 - Services UI | 8 | 9 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 8.2 |
| T3 - OAuth E2E | 9 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 9 | 8.4 |
| T4 - Coding Standards | 9 | 9 | 7 | 9 | 10 | 8.8 |
| T5 - Deploy Guides | 8 | 9 | 8 | 9 | 9 | 8.6 |

### Rejected Prompts

None - All 6 prompts scored ≥7.0 and were approved.

## Velocity Metrics

### This Cycle
- Tasks Created: 6
- Tasks from Last Cycle Completed: 0
- Completion Rate: 0%

### Trend (Last 5 Cycles)

| Cycle | Created | Completed | Rate |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|
| 12 | 6 | 0 | 0% |
| 13 | 6 | 0 | 0% |
| 14 | 6 | 0 | 0% |
| 15 | 0 | 0 | 0% |
| 16 | 6 | 0 | 0% |

**Critical Observation**: 5 cycles with 0% completion rate. Executor activation is BLOCKED.

## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- Strategist identified correct GOVERNANCE PAUSE directive
- All 6 prompts met quality threshold (avg 8.77)
- Clear execution sequence defined (T0 → T1 → T2/T3 → T4/T5)
- Prompts include Quick Start copy-paste activation

### What Needs Improvement
- **Execution gap is 5+ cycles** - governance running, executors idle
- Human activation bottleneck persists
- No autonomous agent launching mechanism

### Action Items for Next Cycle
1. **DO NOT RUN NEXT GOVERNANCE CYCLE** until at least 3 executor tasks complete
2. Human must copy-paste prompts into new Cursor tabs to activate executors
3. Verify T0 (commit) completes before proceeding

---

## Vision Alignment Check

| Principle | Tasks Aligned | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Export-First | 5/6 | Connected services UI supports export flow |
| Zero Lock-In | 4/6 | OAuth tests validate external service flexibility |
| Cursor-Native | 6/6 | All tasks optimized for Claude + Cursor workflow |
| Transparency | 5/6 | Documentation tasks improve onboarding clarity |
| Fail Gracefully | 3/6 | OAuth E2E tests include error handling scenarios |

## Next Cycle

**Scheduled Start**: PAUSED until executor tasks complete
**Trigger**: Human activates executor agents; 3+ tasks complete

### Carry-Forward Items
- Execution gap monitoring (currently 5+ cycles)
- Vercel environment variables (human action)

### Watch Items
- Executor agent activation (critical)
- Task completion velocity (target: 3+ tasks before next audit)

## Executor Launch Commands

Copy these into new Cursor chats to launch agents:

### CLI AGENT (P0 - DO FIRST)
```
Read prompts/agents/roles/CLI.md and execute task T0 from Cycle 16 strategy. 
Commit all uncommitted work and push to origin/main. This is P0 priority.
```

### TESTING AGENT (P1 - After T0)
```
Read prompts/agents/roles/TESTING.md and execute task T1 from Cycle 16 strategy.
Complete the accordion UI tests in website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts.
Verify the new sidebar accordion behavior works correctly. Run npm test to confirm.
```

### WEBSITE AGENT (P2 - After T1)
```
Read prompts/agents/roles/WEBSITE.md and execute task T2 from Cycle 16 strategy.
Create the Connected Services UI component for the configurator.
Backend routes are ready at website/app/api/services/connected/.
Integrate into the accordion sidebar. Follow 5DS dark theme design.
```

### TESTING AGENT (P2 - Can run parallel to T2)
```
Read prompts/agents/roles/TESTING.md and execute task T3 from Cycle 16 strategy.
Create E2E tests for Supabase OAuth flow in website/tests/supabase-oauth.spec.ts.
Reference the UploadThing E2E tests for mock patterns. Test OAuth initiation, 
callback handling, and connected services integration.
```

### DOCUMENTATION AGENT (P3 - After T0-T3)
```
Read prompts/agents/roles/DOCUMENTATION.md and execute task T4 from Cycle 16 strategy.
Create docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md documenting the code style conventions.
Reference existing code in src/dd/ and website/ for examples. Include both .mjs and .ts standards.
```

```
Read prompts/agents/roles/DOCUMENTATION.md and execute task T5 from Cycle 16 strategy.
Create deployment guides at docs/deploy/vercel.md and docs/deploy/netlify.md.
Include step-by-step instructions, environment variable setup, and framework-specific notes.
```
