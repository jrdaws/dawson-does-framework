## Velocity Metrics

### This Cycle
- Tasks Created: 6
- Tasks from Last Cycle Completed: 0 (P0 commit still pending)
- Completion Rate: 0%

### Trend (Last 5 Cycles)
| Cycle | Created | Completed | Rate |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|
| 16 | 6 | 0 | 0% |
| 17 | 6 | 5 | 83% |
| 18 | 5 | 5 | 100% |
| 19 | 4 | 0 | 0% |
| 20 | 6 | 0 | 0% |

**Trend Note**: Execution gap persisting. P0 commit task critical blocker.

## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- All 6 reviewed prompts scored above 7.0 threshold
- Strategist produced well-structured, actionable tasks
- Clear dependency mapping (T0 unblocks all others)

### What Needs Improvement
- P0 commit task has persisted for 8+ cycles
- Executor agents not being launched consistently
- Curator inbox backlog (16 strategy files) needs archival

### Action Items for Next Cycle
- Archive strategy files older than Dec 26
- Do NOT create new strategies until P0 commit is resolved
- Launch executor agents immediately after commit

## Vision Alignment Check

| Principle | Tasks Aligned | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Export-First | 5/6 | UploadThing + Services UI support export flow |
| Zero Lock-In | 4/6 | Services UI shows integration independence |
| Cursor-Native | 6/6 | All tasks executable in Cursor chat |
| Transparency | 5/6 | Documentation tasks improve clarity |
| Fail Gracefully | 3/6 | Testing tasks validate error handling |

## Next Cycle

**Scheduled Start**: 2025-12-27 15:00 NZT (6 hours)
**Trigger**: Auditor reads new commits and test results

### Carry-Forward Items
- P0 Commit task (CRITICAL - 8+ cycles pending)

### Watch Items
- Curator inbox still has 16 files - archive recommended
- Testing Agent has 9+ tasks queued
