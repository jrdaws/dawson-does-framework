## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- All P1 production readiness tasks from previous cycle completed
- Completion reports provided clear context for new task creation
- PROJECT_STATUS.md tracked progress effectively
- Agent handoff notes identified specific follow-up work

### What Needs Improvement
- Strategist drafts folder was empty - need regular strategy cycles
- Legacy prompts in output/agent-prompts/ should be cleaned up
- Velocity tracking needs more historical data

### Action Items for Next Cycle
- Run full Auditor → Strategist → Curator cycle
- Clean up completed legacy prompts
- Track velocity across 5+ cycles for trend analysis

## Vision Alignment Check

| Principle | Tasks Aligned | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Export-First | 5/5 | All tasks support local-first development |
| Zero Lock-In | 5/5 | Integrations designed for independence |
| Cursor-Native | 3/5 | Documentation tasks support workflow |
| Transparency | 4/5 | Unit tests and docs increase transparency |
| Fail Gracefully | 3/5 | Error handling in chunked generation |
