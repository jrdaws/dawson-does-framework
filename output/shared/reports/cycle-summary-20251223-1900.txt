### Approved Prompts

| Task | Vision | Clarity | Complete | Action | Scope | **Total** |
|------|--------|---------|----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| UploadThing Validation | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | **9.0** |
| Design Resources Test | 8 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | **8.8** |

### Rejected Prompts

|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| T1-production-deployment | 7.4 | Assigned to "Human + Website Agent" - not a pure agent task | For human action, not agent inbox |

## Velocity Metrics

### This Cycle
- Tasks Created: 8
- Tasks from Last Cycle Completed: 2 (UploadThing integration, Automation docs)
- Completion Rate: 67% (estimated from previous)

### Trend (Last 5 Cycles)

| Cycle | Created | Completed | Rate |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|
| 1 | 7 | 0 | 0% |
| 2 | 6 | 5 | 71% |

## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- UploadThing integration completed successfully (first storage integration!)
- Automation infrastructure is now mature
- All 693 tests passing consistently
- Controller cycle (Auditor→Strategist→Curator) running smoothly

### What Needs Improvement
- Chunked code generation marked P1 but has scope concerns
- Some tasks accumulating in agent inboxes without being picked up
- Human-dependent blockers (Vercel deployment) not progressing

### Action Items for Next Cycle
- Consider breaking large tasks (chunked generation) into smaller pieces
- Clear backlog of existing inbox tasks before adding more
- Track which tasks are actually being executed

## Vision Alignment Check

| Principle | Tasks Aligned | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Export-First | 8/8 | All tasks improve export experience |
| Zero Lock-In | 8/8 | No platform dependencies introduced |
| Cursor-Native | 6/8 | Tasks designed for Claude execution |
| Transparency | 8/8 | All tasks include clear criteria |
| Fail Gracefully | 5/8 | Some tasks need error handling focus |
