## Progress Assessment

### Goals Met
- [x] UploadThing storage integration complete (first storage integration!)
- [x] Automation infrastructure mature (Keyboard Maestro, shell scripts)
- [x] Continuous improvement system operational (AUDITOR/STRATEGIST/CURATOR)
- [x] All 693 tests passing
- [x] 4 improvement cycles completed successfully

### Goals In Progress
- [ ] Production deployment to Vercel - 90% (prep complete, execution pending)
- [ ] Chunked code generation - Not started (task created)
- [ ] User testing - 0% (waiting for deployment)

### Goals Not Started
- [ ] Visual code editing in browser
- [ ] Paddle payments integration
- [ ] NextAuth integration

---

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (P1)
1. **Production not deployed** - All prep complete, Vercel deployment guide ready, but actual deployment hasn't happened. Blocking user testing.

### Important Gaps (P2)
1. **Uncommitted work pending** - 9 modified files and 21 untracked files need to be committed
2. **UploadThing not tested in exported project** - Integration complete but not validated end-to-end
3. **No chunked code generation** - Complex projects still truncate at output limits

### Minor Gaps (P3)
1. **Strategist has pending draft tasks** - 9 draft tasks in outbox awaiting curation
2. **Velocity metrics incomplete** - Limited data in velocity-log.csv
3. **Design resources directory added** - `templates/saas/design/` and `docs/design/` appear new but not committed

---

## Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Owner | Resolution Path |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Vercel deployment requires human action | High | Human | Execute deployment via Vercel dashboard using docs/deploy/VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md |
| Uncommitted changes in workspace | Med | Any Agent | Run `git add -A && git commit` to preserve work |
| No Anthropic API key in CI for live tests | Low | Platform | Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret to GitHub |

---

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

### Priority 1 (Must Do)
1. **Commit pending changes** - 30+ files of uncommitted work at risk of being lost
2. **Execute Vercel deployment** - All preparation is complete, blocking user testing

### Priority 2 (Should Do)
1. **Test UploadThing in exported project** - Validate integration works end-to-end
2. **Start chunked code generation** - Fix truncation for complex projects

### Priority 3 (Could Do)
1. **Create user feedback collection mechanism** - Prepare for user testing phase
2. **Curate pending Strategist drafts** - 9 tasks waiting in drafts folder
