## Quality Assessment

### Approved Prompts

| Task | Clarity | Completeness | Alignment | Actionability | Scope | Total |
|------|---------|--------------|-----------|---------------|-------|-------|
| T1: UploadThing Validation | 9 | 10 | 9 | 9 | 8 | 9.0 |
| T2: Deployment Guide | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9.0 |
| T3: Design Resources | 9 | 9 | 8 | 9 | 9 | 8.8 |
| LAUNCH-Testing | 9 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 8 | 8.8 |
| LAUNCH-Documentation | 9 | 9 | 9 | 10 | 9 | 9.2 |

### Rejected Prompts

| Task | Score | Reason | Disposition |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| None | - | - | All drafts passed quality threshold |

## Velocity Metrics

### This Cycle
- Tasks Created: 0 (execution focus)
- Tasks from Last Cycle Completed: 0 (no agents launched)
- Completion Rate: N/A

### Trend (Last 5 Cycles)
| Cycle | Created | Completed | Rate |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|
| Cycle 2 | 5 | 7 | 140% |
| Cycle 3 | 3 | 0 | 0% |
| Cycle 5 | 8 | 2 | 25% |
| Cycle 6 | 0 | 0 | N/A |
| Cycle 8 | 0 | 0 | N/A |

**Critical Observation**: Task creation has outpaced execution. 16 tasks created, 9 completed. 9 tasks remain in queue.

## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- Auditor-Strategist chain provided clear situation analysis
- Task files are well-structured with clear success criteria
- No duplicate or conflicting tasks (cleanup in Cycle 6 helped)
- All drafts scored above 8.5/10 - high quality planning

### What Needs Improvement
- Execution gap: tasks accumulating without being worked
- No worker agents have been activated since Cycle 5
- Human deployment blocker persists

### Action Items for Next Cycle
- CRITICAL: Actually launch the worker agents this time
- Monitor completion of T1, T2, T3 before next Auditor run
- Consider reducing PDCA frequency until execution catches up

## Vision Alignment Check

| Principle | Tasks Aligned | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Export-First | 3/3 | All tasks support export capability |
| Zero Lock-In | 3/3 | Testing validates optional integrations |
| Cursor-Native | 3/3 | All tasks executable by AI agents in Cursor |
| Transparency | 3/3 | Clear success criteria, no magic |
| Fail Gracefully | 2/3 | Need to add error handling guidance to T1 |

## Next Cycle

**Scheduled Start**: 2025-12-24 10:30 (6 hours)
**Trigger**: Auditor reads new commits and test results

### Carry-Forward Items
- T4: Chunked Code Generation (Platform Agent) - deferred, high complexity
- T5: User Feedback API (Website Agent) - blocked on deployment
- T6-T9: Backlog items

### Watch Items
- Worker agent completion of T1, T2, T3
- Human production deployment
- Test count stability (693 should remain or increase)

## Executor Launch Commands

Copy these into new Cursor chats to launch agents:

### TESTING AGENT (Launch FIRST - 2 Tasks)
```
I'm the Testing Agent. I need to execute two validation tasks:

1. Read my task: output/testing-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P1-task-uploadthing-validation.txt
2. Execute UploadThing validation per the task instructions
3. When complete, read: output/testing-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P2-task-design-resources-validation.txt
4. Execute Design Resources validation
5. Move completed tasks to done/, write reports to outbox/
```

### DOCUMENTATION AGENT (Launch in Parallel)
```
I'm the Documentation Agent. I need to execute one task:

1. Read my task: output/documentation-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P2-task-deployment-execution-guide.txt
2. Create the Vercel deployment checklist per the task instructions
3. Move completed task to done/, update my memory file
```
