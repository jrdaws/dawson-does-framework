# Strategy Report

Cycle: 10
Date: 2025-12-24 17:30
Strategist: STRATEGIST Agent
Responding to: audit-20251224-1700.txt

## Executive Summary

Exceptional progress in Cycle 9: 34 commits, 694 tests passing, and **no critical gaps identified**. The framework is in excellent health with Phase 1 complete. This cycle focuses on consolidation: filling documentation gaps, adding UI test coverage, and maintaining quality while the human completes Vercel configuration.

---

## Strategic Priorities

Based on Auditor's findings, this cycle focuses on:

1. **Documentation Debt Payoff**: Create missing CODING_STANDARDS.md and deployment guides. These are referenced but don't exist, causing dead links and reducing developer experience.

2. **UI Test Coverage**: Add Playwright tests for the configurator component. Testing Agent identified this as a coverage gap.

3. **Quality Maintenance**: Keep the test suite green (694 tests), ensure no regressions while consolidating.

## Task Matrix

| ID | Task | Agent | Priority | Effort | Depends On |
|----|------|-------|----------|--------|------------|
| T1 | Create CODING_STANDARDS.md | Documentation | P2 | Medium | None |
| T2 | Create Deployment Guides | Documentation | P2 | Medium | None |
| T3 | Add Configurator UI Tests | Testing | P2 | Medium | None |
| T4 | Review SOP Registry | Quality | P3 | Low | None |
| T5 | Scaffold Without Env Check | CLI | P2 | Medium | None |

**Note**: Vercel primary domain fix requires human action (not an agent task).

---

## Draft Task Prompts

### T1: Create CODING_STANDARDS.md

```
# Task: Create CODING_STANDARDS.md

Priority: P2
Assigned To: Documentation Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Medium (~45 min)

## Context
The Auditor identified that docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md is referenced in multiple 
files but doesn't exist. This causes dead links and confusion for developers.

## Objectives
1. Create comprehensive coding standards document
2. Cover JavaScript ESM (.mjs) and TypeScript (.ts) rules
3. Include naming conventions, import ordering, error handling
4. Add good/bad code examples

## Success Criteria
- [ ] docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md exists
- [ ] Covers semicolon rules (none in .mjs, required in .ts)
- [ ] Covers 2-space indentation
- [ ] Covers naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase)
- [ ] Includes practical code examples
- [ ] No dead links to this file

## Files to Create
- docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md

## Reference
- AGENT_CONTEXT.md (coding standards section)
- Existing code patterns in src/dd/*.mjs and website/*.ts

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Commit: git add -A && git commit -m "docs(standards): create CODING_STANDARDS.md"
3. Update PROJECT_PRIORITIES.md (remove from backlog)
```

### T2: Create Deployment Guides

```
# Task: Create Deployment Guides

Priority: P2
Assigned To: Documentation Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Medium (~45 min)

## Context
Testing Agent found dead links to deployment guides (vercel.md, netlify.md, railway.md).
These need to be created to prevent 404s and help users deploy.

## Objectives
1. Create docs/deployment/vercel.md
2. Create docs/deployment/netlify.md
3. Create docs/deployment/railway.md
4. Link from docs/deployment/README.md

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All three deployment guides exist
- [ ] Each includes environment variable setup
- [ ] Each includes step-by-step deployment instructions
- [ ] No dead links in documentation
- [ ] Tested: all links work

## Files to Create
- docs/deployment/vercel.md
- docs/deployment/netlify.md
- docs/deployment/railway.md

## Reference
- Existing docs/deploy/VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md (merge or consolidate)
- docs/deployment/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Commit: git add -A && git commit -m "docs(deployment): add Vercel, Netlify, Railway guides"
3. Update PROJECT_PRIORITIES.md (remove from backlog)
```

### T3: Add Configurator UI Tests

```
# Task: Add Configurator UI Tests

Priority: P2
Assigned To: Testing Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Medium (~1 hour)

## Context
The Auditor identified a coverage gap: the configurator component lacks UI tests.
This is the core user-facing feature and needs E2E test coverage.

## Objectives
1. Create Playwright tests for configurator flow
2. Test step navigation (1→2→3→4)
3. Test template selection
4. Test integration toggle
5. Test export modal

## Success Criteria
- [ ] website/tests/configurator.spec.ts exists
- [ ] Tests all 4 configurator steps
- [ ] Tests template selection functionality
- [ ] Tests export options (CLI, ZIP)
- [ ] All tests pass: npm run test:e2e
- [ ] CI includes these tests

## Files to Create/Modify
- website/tests/configurator.spec.ts (create)
- website/playwright.config.ts (verify includes new test)

## Commands
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework/website
npm run dev &
npx playwright test tests/configurator.spec.ts

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Commit: git add -A && git commit -m "test(website): add configurator E2E tests"
3. Update TESTING_MEMORY.md with coverage notes
```

### T4: Review SOP Registry

```
# Task: Review SOP Registry

Priority: P3
Assigned To: Quality Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low (~30 min)

## Context
With 14 SOPs now active, the Quality Agent should review for:
- Duplicate or conflicting procedures
- Outdated references
- Gaps in coverage

## Objectives
1. Audit all 14 active SOPs
2. Flag any conflicts or duplicates
3. Identify outdated file paths (from folder migration)
4. Recommend consolidations if any

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 14 SOPs reviewed
- [ ] No conflicting procedures
- [ ] File paths updated for new agent folder structure
- [ ] Report saved to outbox/

## Files to Check
- prompts/agents/sops/*.md
- prompts/agents/roles/*.md
- prompts/agents/roles/controllers/*.md

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Save report to outbox/sop-review-report.md
3. Flag issues to Curator if critical
```

### T5: Scaffold Without Env Check

```
# Task: Enable Export Without Env Vars

Priority: P2
Assigned To: CLI Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Medium (~45 min)

## Context
Users report friction when exporting projects with integrations. The CLI 
currently requires environment variables during scaffolding, but should only 
validate at runtime.

## Objectives
1. Remove or defer env validation during export
2. Generate .env.local.example with all required vars
3. Add clear env setup instructions to generated README

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `npx @jrdaws/framework export saas ./test --payments stripe` works without env
- [ ] Generated .env.local.example includes all required variables
- [ ] README includes "Environment Setup" section
- [ ] All existing tests pass: npm test

## Files to Modify
- bin/framework.js (export command)
- src/dd/export.mjs (env validation logic)

## Commands
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework
npm test  # Before changes
# Make changes
npm test  # After changes
rm -rf ./test  # Clean up test project

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Commit: git add -A && git commit -m "feat(cli): allow export without env vars"
3. Update CLI_MEMORY.md
```

## Deferred Items

Tasks explicitly NOT included this cycle:

- **Chunked Code Generation**: Complex, requires Platform Agent focus; defer until after consolidation
- **User Feedback Collection**: Depends on stable production deployment
- **Visual Code Editing**: Phase 2b feature, not blocking
- **Velocity Tracking Automation**: Nice-to-have, low priority

---

## Execution Order Recommendation

Since all tasks are independent, launch in parallel for maximum velocity:

```
PARALLEL LAUNCH:
├── Documentation Agent → T1 + T2 (coding standards + deployment guides)
├── Testing Agent → T3 (configurator UI tests)
├── Quality Agent → T4 (SOP review)
└── CLI Agent → T5 (scaffold without env)

Human Action (Async):
└── Vercel Dashboard → Set Root Dir=website
```

---

## Quality Checklist

- [x] Read and incorporated Auditor's recommendations
- [x] Every task has clear success criteria
- [x] Tasks are appropriately sized (completable in <6 hours)
- [x] Dependencies are clearly stated (none - all parallel)
