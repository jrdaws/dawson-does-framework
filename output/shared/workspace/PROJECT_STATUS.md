## Executive Summary

A hybrid platform for building web apps with a visual configurator, then exporting to full local ownership via CLI. Optimized for Claude + Cursor workflow.

## Known Issues

### Uncommitted Work ⚠️ (CRITICAL)
- **Issue:** 58 files uncommitted (16 modified, 13 deleted, 29 untracked)
- **Cycles Overdue:** 8+ (since Cycle 11)
- **Fix:** `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: commit Cycle 19 governance work" && git push`

### Execution Gap Status ⚠️ (PERSISTS)
- **Issue:** Tasks distributed but not picked up by executor agents
- **Pattern:** Governance loop completes (Auditor → Strategist → Curator) but execution stalls
- **Backlog:** CLI (2), Testing (7), Documentation (5), Curator (15), Quality (2), Website (7)
- **Trend:** Negative - backlog growing, no executor activity this cycle

### Curator Inbox Overflow ⚠️ (NEW)
- **Issue:** 15 strategy files pending in Curator inbox
- **Impact:** Tasks not being distributed to executor agents
- **Fix:** Activate Curator Agent to process inbox or archive old files

### Vercel Primary Domain (Low)
- **Issue:** Primary domain needs dashboard configuration
- **Impact:** Alt domain works, primary domain needs Root Dir=website setting
- **Fix:** Human action in Vercel dashboard

### Missing Documentation (Minor)
- **Issue:** Some referenced docs don't exist (vercel.md, netlify.md, CODING_STANDARDS.md)
- **Impact:** Dead links in documentation
- **Fix:** Documentation Agent can create these files

## Next Priorities

### P0 - Immediate (CRITICAL)
1. **Commit uncommitted work** - 58 files need to be committed IMMEDIATELY
   - `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: commit Cycle 19 governance work" && git push`

### P1 - Must Do
1. **Process Curator inbox** - 15 strategy files pending
2. **Clear Testing backlog** - 7 tasks pending, oldest from 2025-12-23
3. **Activate CLI Agent** - P0 commit task waiting

### P2 - Should Do
1. **Add connected services UI** - Backend routes ready
2. **Complete accordion sidebar tests**
3. **Review Navy theme QA report**

### P3 - Could Do
1. **Create missing documentation** - CODING_STANDARDS.md, deployment guides
2. **Archive old Curator inbox files** - 12 files from 2025-12-23/24
