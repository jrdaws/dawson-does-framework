## Handoff Notes

All path migration work is complete. The framework now uses a consistent flat agent folder structure:
- Agent folders: `output/agents/[role]/`
- Media pipeline: `output/media-pipeline/`
- Shared resources: `output/shared/`

## Next Recommended Action

Continue with remaining documentation tasks or activate another agent as needed.
